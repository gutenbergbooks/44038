<h2>Preface.</h2>


<p>As a geologist of the United States Geological
Survey, I had the good fortune to be
placed in charge of the first expedition sent by
that department into the interior of Alaska.
The gold diggings of the Yukon region were not
then known to the world in general, yet to those
interested in mining their renown had come in a
vague way, and the special problem with which
I was charged was their investigation. The results
of my studies were embodied in a report
entitled: "Geology of the Yukon Gold District,"
published by the Government.</p>

<p>It was during my travels through the mining
regions that the Klondike discovery, which subsequently
turned so many heads throughout all
of the civilized nations, was made. General conditions
of mining, travelling and prospecting are
much the same to-day as they were at that time,
except in the limited districts into which the
flood of miners has poured. My travels in Alaska
have been extensive since the journey of which
this work is a record, and I have noted the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
scenes that are herein described, in many other
parts of the vast untravelled Territory. It will
take two or three decades or more, to make
alterations in this region and change the condition
throughout.</p>

<p>In recording, therefore, the scenes and hardships
encountered in this northern country, I
describe the experiences of one who to-day
knocks about the Yukon region, the Copper
River region, the Cook Inlet region, the Koyukuk,
or the Nome District. My aim has been
throughout, to set down what I saw and encountered
as fully and simply as possible, and I
have endeavored to keep myself from sacrificing
accuracy to picturesqueness. That my duties led
me to see more than would the ordinary traveller,
I trust the following pages will bear witness.</p>

<p>Let the reader, therefore, when he finds tedious
or unpleasant passages, remember that they record
tedious or unpleasant incidents that one
who travels this vast region cannot escape, as
will be found should any of those who peruse
these pages go <span class="smcap">through the Yukon Gold
Diggings</span>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
THE TRIP TO DYEA.</h2>


<p>It was in 1896, before the Klondike boom. We
were seated at the table of an excursion
steamer, which plied from Seattle northward
among the thousand wonderful mountain islands
of the Inland Passage. It was a journey replete
with brilliant spectacles, through many picturesque
fjords from whose unfathomable depths the
bare steep cliffs rise to dizzy heights, while over
them tumble in disorderly loveliness cataracts
pure as snow, leaping from cliff to cliff in very
wildness, like embodiments of the untamed
spirits of nature.</p>

<p>We had just passed Queen Charlotte Sound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
where the swells from the open sea roll in during
rough weather, and many passengers were
appearing at the table with the pale face and
defiant look which mark the unfortunate who
has newly committed the crime of seasickness.
It only enhanced the former stiffness, which we
of the flannel shirt and the unblacked boot
had striven in vain to break&mdash;for these were people
who were gathered from the corners of the
earth, and each individual, or each tiny group,
seemed to have some invisible negative attraction
for all the rest, like the little molecules
which, scientists imagine, repel their neighbors
to the very verge of explosion. They were all
sight-seers of experience, come, some to do
Alaska, some to rest from mysterious labors,
some&mdash;but who shall fathom at a glance an apparently
dull lot of apparent snobs? At any
rate, one would have thought the everlasting
hills would have shrunk back and the stolid
glaciers blushed with vexation at the patronizing
way with which they were treated in general.
It was depressing&mdash;even European tourists'
wordy enthusiasm over a mud puddle or a dunghill
would have been preferable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>There are along this route all the benefits of a
sea trip&mdash;the air, the rest&mdash;with none of its disadvantages.
So steep are the shores that the
steamer may often lie alongside of them when
she stops and run her gang-plank out on the
rocks. These stops show the traveller the little
human life there is in this vast and desolate
country. There are villages of the native tribes,
with dwellings built in imitation of the common
American fashion, in front of which rise great
totem poles, carved and painted, representing
grinning and grotesque animal-like, or human-like,
or dragon-like figures, one piled on top of
the other up to the very top of the column. A
sort of ancestral tree, these are said to be,&mdash;only
to be understood with a knowledge of the sign
symbolism of these people&mdash;telling of their tribe
and lineage, of their great-grandfather the bear,
and their great-grandmother the wolf or such
strange things.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>The people themselves, with their heavy faces
and their imitation of the European dress&mdash;for
the tourist and the prospector have brought
prosperity and the thin veneer of civilization to
these southernmost tribes of Alaska&mdash;with their
flaming neckerchief or head-kerchief of red and
yellow silk that the silk-worm had no part in
making, but only the cunning Yankee weaver,
paddle out in boats dug from the great evergreen
trees that cover the hills so thickly, and
bring articles made of sealskin, or skilfully
woven baskets made out of the fibres of spruce
roots, to sell to the passengers. Or the steamer
may stop at a little hamlet of white pioneers,
where there is fishing for halibut, with perhaps
some mining for gold on a small scale; then the
practical men of the party, who have hitherto
been bored, can inquire whether the industry
pays, and contemplate in their suddenly awakened
fancies the possibilities of a halibut syndicate,
or another Treadwell gold mine. So the
artist gets his colors and forms, the business man
sees wonderful possibilities in this shockingly
unrailroaded wilderness, the tired may rest body
and mind in the perfect peace and freedom from
the human element, old ladies may sleep and
young ones may flirt meantimes.</p>

<p>All this would seem to prove that the passengers
were neither professional nor business men,
nor young nor old ladies&mdash;part of which appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to me manifestly, and the rest probably untrue;
or else that they were all enthusiastic and interested
in the dumb British-American way, which
sets down as vulgar any betrayal of one's self to
one's neighbors.</p>

<p>Some one at the table wearily and warily inquired
when we should get to the Muir glacier,
on which point we of the flannel-shirted brotherhood
were informed; and incidentally we remarked
that we intended to leave the festivities
before that time, in Juneau.</p>

<p>"Oh my!" said the sad-faced, middle-aged lady
with circles about her eyes. "Stay in Juneau!
How dreadful! Are you going as missionaries,
or," here she wrestled for an idea, "or are you
simply going."</p>

<p>"We are going to the Yukon," we answered,
"from Juneau. You may have heard of the gold
fields of the Yukon country." And strange and
sweet to say, at this later day, no one had heard
of the gold fields&mdash;that was before they had become
the rage and the fashion.</p>

<p>But the whole table warmed with interest&mdash;they
were as lively busybodies as other people
and we were the first solution to the problems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which they had been putting to themselves concerning
each other since the beginning of the
trip. There was a fire of small questions.</p>

<p>"How interesting!" said an elderly young
lady, who sat opposite. "I suppose you will have
<i>all kinds</i> of experiences, just <i>roughing</i> it; and
will you take your food with you on&mdash;er&mdash;wagons&mdash;or
will you depend on the farmhouses along
the way? Only," she added hastily, detecting a
certain gleam in the eye of her vis-a-vis, "I didn't
think there were many farmhouses."</p>

<p>"They will ride horses, Jane," said the bluff
old gentleman who was evidently her father, so
authoritatively that I dared not dispute him&mdash;"everybody
does in that country." Then, as
some glanced out at the precipitous mountain-side
and dense timber, he added, "Of course, not here.
In the interior it is flat, like our plains, and one
rides on little horses,&mdash;I think they call them
kayaks&mdash;I have read it," he said, looking at me
fiercely. Then, as we were silent, he continued,
more condescendingly, "I have roughed it myself,
when I was young. We used to go hunting
every fall in Pennsylvania, when I was a boy,
and once two of us went off together and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
gone a week, just riding over the roughest country
roads and into the mountains on horseback.
If our coffee had not run out we would have
stayed longer."</p>

<p>"But isn't it dreadfully cold up there?" said
the sweet brown-eyed girl, with a look in her
eyes that wakened in our hearts the first momentary
rebellion against our exile. "And the wild
animals! You will suffer so."</p>

<p>"I used to know an explorer," said the business
man with the green necktie, who had been dragged
to the shrine of Nature by his wife. He had
brought along an entire copy of the New York
<i>Screamer</i>, and buried himself all day long in its
parti-colored mysteries. "He told me many
things that might be useful to you, if I could remember
them. About spearing whales&mdash;for food,
you know&mdash;you will have to do a lot of that. I
wish I could have you meet him sometime; he
could tell you much more than I can. Somebody
said there was gold up there. Was it you?
Well don't get frozen up and drift across the
Pole, like Nansen, just to get where the gold is.
But I suppose the nuggets&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's go on deck, Jane," said the old gentleman;&mdash;then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to us, politely but firmly, "I have
been much interested in your account, and shall
be glad to hear more later." We had not said
anything yet.</p>

<p>We disembarked at Juneau. We had watched
the shore for nearly the whole trip without perceiving
a rift in the mountains through which it
looked feasible to pass, and at Juneau the outlook
or uplook was no better. Those who have been
to Juneau (and they are now many) know how
slight and almost insecure is its foothold; how it
is situated on an irregular hilly area which looks
like a great landslide from the mountains towering
above, whose sides are so sheer that the
wagon road which winds up the gulch into Silver
Bow basin is for some distance in the nature of a
bridge, resting on wooden supports and hugging
close to the steep rock wall. The excursionists
tarried a little here, buying furs at extortionate
prices from the natives, fancy baskets, and little
ornaments which are said to be made in Connecticut.</p>

<p>In the hotel the proprietor arrived at our business
in the shortest possible time, by the method
of direct questioning. He was from Colorado, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
judged&mdash;all the men I have known that look like
him come from Colorado. There was also a
heavily bearded man dressed in ill-fitting store-clothes,
and with a necktie which had the strangest
air of being ill at ease, who was lounging
near by, smoking and spitting on the floor contemplatively.</p>

<p>"Here, Pete," said the proprietor, "I want you
to meet these gentlemen." He pronounced the
last word with such a peculiar intonation that one
felt sure he used it as synonymous with "tenderfeet"
or "paperlegs" or other terms by which
Alaskans designate greenhorns.</p>

<p>I had rather had him call me "this feller."
"He says he's goin' over the Pass, an' maybe
you can help each other." Pete smiled genially
and crushed my hand, looking me full in the eye
the while, doubtless to see how I stood the ordeal.
"Pete's an old timer," continued the
hotel-man, "one of the Yukon pioneers. Been
over that Pass&mdash;how many times, Pete, three
times, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Dis makes dirt time," answered Pete, with
a most unique dialect, which nevertheless was
Scandinavian. "Virst time, me an' Frank Densmore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Whisky Bill an' de odder boys. Dat was
summer som we washed on Stewart River, on'y
us&mdash;fetched out britty peek sack dat year&mdash;eh?"
He had a curious way of retaining the Scandinavian
relative pronoun <i>som</i> in his English, instead
of <i>who</i> or <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>"You bet, Pete," answered the other, "you
painted the town; done your duty by us."</p>

<p>"Ja," said Pete, "blewed it in; mostly in
'Frisco. Was king dat winter till dust was all
been spent. Saw tings dat was goot; saw udder
tings was too bad, efen for Alaskan miner. One
time enough. I tink dese cities kind of bad fer
people. So I get out. Sez I,&mdash;'I jes' got time
to get to Lake Bennett by time ice breaks,' so I
light out." He smiled happily as he said this,
as a man might talk of going home, then continued,
"Den secon' dime I get a glaim Forty
Mile, Miller Greek,&mdash;dat's really Sixty Mile, but
feller gits dere f'm Forty Mile. Had a pardner,
but he went down to Birch Greek, den I work
my glaim alone."</p>

<p>He put his hand down in his trousers pocket
and brought up a large flat angular piece of gold,
two inches long; it had particles of quartz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
scattered through, and was in places rusty with
iron, but was mostly smooth and showed the
wearing it must have had in his pocket. He
shoved the yellow lump into my hand. "Dat
nugget was de biggest in my glaim dat I found;
anoder feller he washed over tailin's f'm my
glaim efter, an' he got bigger nuggets, he says,
but I tinks he's dam liar. Anyhow, I get
little sack an' I went down 'Frisco, an' I blewed
it in again. Now I go back once more."</p>

<p>We talked awhile and finally agreed to make
the trip to Forty Mile together, since we were
all bound to this place, and Pete, unlike most
miners and prospectors, had no "pardner." We
were soon engaged in making the rounds of the
shops, laying in our supplies&mdash;beans, bacon,
dried fruit, flour, sugar, cheese, and, most precious
of all, a bucket of strawberry jam. We
made up our minds to revel in jam just as long
as we were able, even if we ended up on plain
flour three times a day. For a drink we took
tea, which is almost universally used in Alaska,
instead of coffee, since a certain weight of it will
last as long as many times the same weight of
coffee: moreover, there is some quality in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
beverage which makes it particularly adapted to
the vigorous climate and conditions of this northern
country. Men who have never used tea acquire
a fondness for it in Alaska, and will drink
vast quantities, especially in the winter. The
Russians, themselves the greatest tea-drinkers of
all European nations, long ago introduced
"Tschai" to the Alaskan natives; and throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the country they will beg for it from every
white man they meet, or will travel hundreds of
miles and barter their furs to obtain it.</p>

</div>

<p>Concerning the amount of supplies it is necessary
to take on a trip like ours, it may be remarked
that three pounds of solid food to each
man per day, is liberal. As to the proportion,
no constant estimate can be made, men's appetites
varying with the nature of the articles in
the rations and their temporary tastes. On this
occasion Pete picked out the supplies, laying in
what he judged to be enough of each article: but
it appeared afterwards that a man may be an experienced
pioneer, and yet never have solved the
problem of reasonably accurate rations, for some
articles were soon exhausted on our trip, while
others lasted throughout the summer, after
which we were obliged to bequeath the remainder
to the natives. Camp kettles, and frying-pans,
of course, were in the outfit, as well as
axes, boat-building tools, whip-saw, draw-shave,
chisels, hammers, nails, screws, oakum and pitch.
It was our plan to build a boat on the lakes
which are the source of the Yukon, felling the
spruce trees, and then with a whip-saw slicing off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
boards, which when put together would carry
us down the river to the gold diggings.</p>

<p>For our personal use we had a single small
tent, A-shaped, but with half of one of the
large slanting sides cut out, so that it could be
elevated like a curtain, and, being secured at the
corners by poles or tied by ropes to trees, made
an additional shelter, while it opened up the interior
of the tent to the fresh air or the warmth
of the camp-fire outside. Blankets for sleeping,
and rubber blankets to lay next to the ground to
keep out the wet; the best mosquito-netting or
"bobinet" of hexagonal mesh, and stout gauntleted
cavalry gloves, as protection against the
mosquitoes. For personal attire, anything.
Dress on the frontier, above all in Alaska, is
always varied, picturesque, and unconventional.
Flannel or woollen shirts, of course, are universal;
and for foot gear the heavy laced boot is
the best.</p>

<p>As usual, we were led by the prospective terrors
of cold water in the lakes and streams to
invest in rubber boots reaching to the hip, which,
however, did not prove of such use as anticipated.
We had brought with us canvas bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
designed for packing, or carrying loads on the
back, of a model long used in the Lake Superior
woods. They were provided with suitable straps
for the shoulders, and a broad one for the top of
the head, so that the toiler, bending over, might
support a large part of the load by the aid of his
rigid neck. These we utilized also as receptacles
for our clothes and other personal articles.</p>

<p>Other men were in Juneau also, bound for the
Yukon,&mdash;not like the hordes that the Klondike
brought up later from the States, many of whom
turned back before even crossing the passes, but
small parties of determined men. We ran upon
them here and there. In the hotel we sat down
at the table with a self-contained man with a
suggestion of recklessness or carelessness in his
face, and soon found that he was bound over the
same route as ourselves, on a newspaper mission.
Danlon, as we may call him, had brought his
manservant with him, like the Englishman he
was. He was a great traveller, and full of interesting
anecdotes of Afghanistan, or Borneo, or
some other of the earth's corners. He had engaged
to go with him a friend of Pete's, another
pioneer, Cooper by name, short, blonde and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
powerfully built. Between us, we arranged for
a tug to take us the hundred miles of water
which still lay between us and Dyea, where the
land journey begins; after which transaction,
we sat down to eat our last dinner in civilization.
How tearfully, almost, we remarked that this
was the last plum-pudding we should have for
many a moon!</p>

<p>We sailed, or rather steamed away, from
Juneau in the evening. Our tug had been designed
for freight, and had not been altered in
the slightest degree for the accommodation of
passengers. Her floor space, too, was limited, so
that while ten or twelve men might have made
themselves very comfortable, the fifty or sixty
who finally appeared on board found hard work
to dispose of themselves in any fashion. She
had been originally engaged for our two parties,
but new passengers continually applied, who,
from the nature of things, could hardly be refused.
So the motley crowd of strangers huddled
together, the engines began clanking, and
the lights of Juneau soon dropped out of sight,
as we steamed up Lynn Canal under the shadow
of the giant mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Our fellow-passengers were mostly prospectors;
nearly all newcomers, as we could see by
the light of the lantern which hung up in the
bare apartment where we were. They had their
luggage and outfit with them, which they piled
up and sat or slept on, to make sure they would
not lose it. There were men with grey beards
and strapping boys with down on their chins;
white handed men and those whose huge horny
palms showed a life of toil; all strange, uneasy,
and quiet at first, but soon they began to talk
confidentially, as men will whom chance throws
together in strange places.</p>

<p>There was a Catholic priest bound to his
mission among the Eskimos on the lower Yukon,&mdash;calm,
patient, sweet-tempered, and cheerful of
speech; and near him was a noted Alaskan pioneer
and trader, bound on some wild trip or
other alone. There was another Alaskan&mdash;one
of those who settle down and take native women
as mates and are therefore somewhat scornfully
called "squaw-men"; he had been to Juneau as
the countryman visits the metropolis, and had
brought back with him abundant evidence of the
worthlessness of the no-liquor laws of Alaska, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the shape of a lordly drunk, and the material for
many more, in a large demijohn, which he
guarded carefully. The conversation among
this crowd was of the directest sort, as it is always
on the frontier.</p>

<p>"Where are <i>you</i> goin', pardner? Prospectin',
I reckon?"</p>

<p>Then inquiries as to what each could tell the
other concerning the conditions of the land we
were to explore, mostly unknown to all: and
straightway Pete and Cooper were constituted
authorities, by virtue of their previous experience,
and were listened to with great deference
by the rest. The night was not calm, and the
little craft swashed monotonously into the
waves. One by one the travellers lay down on
the bare dusty floor and slept; and so limited
was the room that the last found it difficult to
find a place.</p>

<p>Glancing around to find a vacant nook I was
struck with the picturesqueness of the scene.
Under the lantern the last talkers&mdash;the Catholic
priest in a red sweater, smoking a bent pipe, the
professional traveller and book-maker, and
another Englishman with smooth face and oily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
manners,&mdash;were discussing matters with as much
reserve and decorum as they would in a drawing-room.
Around them lay stretched out, over
the floor, under the table, and even on it, motley-clad
men, breathing heavily or staring with
wide fixed eyes overhead. The pioneer had
gone to sleep lying on his back and was snoring
at intervals, but by a physical feat hard to
understand, retained his quid of tobacco, which
he chewed languidly through it all. The only
space I could find was in a narrow passageway
leading to the pilot-house. Here I coiled myself,
hugging closely to the wall, but it was dark
and throughout the night I was awakened by
heavy boots accidentally placed on my body or
head; yet I was too sleepy to hear the apologies
and straightway slept again.</p>

<p>It was natural, under the circumstances, that
all should be early risers, and we were ravenously
hungry for the breakfast which was tardily
prepared. The only table was covered with oilcloth,
and was calculated for four, but about eight
managed to crowd around it: yet with all possible
haste the last had breakfast about noon.
We sat down where a momentary opening was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
offered at the third or fourth sitting. A moment
later a couple of prospectors appeared who apparently
had counted on places, and the hungry
stomach of one of them prompted some very
audible mutterings to the effect that all men
were born free and equal, and he was as good as
any one. The priest immediately got up, and
with sincere kindness offered his seat, which so
overcame the man with shame that he politely
refused and retired; but the rest of us insisted
on crowding together and making room for him.
And for the remainder of the trip a more punctiliously
polite individual than this same prospector
could not be found.</p>

<p>After each round of eaters, the tin plates and
cups and the dingy black knives and forks were
seized by a busy dishwasher, who performed a
rapid hocus-pocus over them, in which a tiny
dishpan filled with hot water that came finally
to have the appearance and consistency of a
hodge-podge, played an important part; then
they were skillfully shyed on to the table again.
I looked at my plate. Swimming in the shallow
film of dish-water, were flakes of beans, shreds
of corned-beef and streaks of apple-sauce, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
took me back in fancy to all the different tables
that had eaten before: the boat was swaying
heavily and I gulped down my stomach before I
passed the plate to the dishwasher and suggested
wiping. He was a very young man, remarkably
dashing, like the hero of a dime novel. He was
especially proficient in profanity and kept up a
running fire of insults on the cook. He took the
plate and eyed me scornfully, witheringly.</p>

<p>"Seems to me some tenderfeet is mighty pertickler,"
said he, with a very evident personal
application, then swabbed out the plate with
a towel, the sight of which made me turn and
stare at the spruce-clad mountain-sides, in a desperate
effort to elevate my mind and my stomach
above trifles.</p>

<p>"This is no place for a white man," said a
prospector who had been staring out of the door
all day. "Good enough for bears and&mdash;and&mdash;Siwash,
maybe." Most, I think shared more or
less openly his depression, for the shores of Lynn
Canal are no more attractive to the adventurer
than the rest of the bleak Alaskan mountain
coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a chilly, drizzling day. The clouds ordinarily
hid the tops of the great steep mountains,
so that these looked as if they might be
walls that reached clear up to the heavens, or,
when they broke away, exposed lofty snowy
peaks, magnificent and gigantic in the mist. We
caught glimpses of wrinkled glaciers, crawling
down the valleys like huge jointed living things,
in whose fronts the pure blue ice showed faintly
and coldly. Here and there waterfalls appeared,
leaping hundreds of feet from crag to crag, and
all along was the rugged brown shore, with the
surf lashing the cliffs, and no place where even a
boat might land. All men, whether they clearly
perceive it or not, find in the phenomena of Nature
some figurative meanings, and are depressed
or elevated by them.</p>

<p>We anchored in the lee of a bare rounded
mountain that night, it being too rough to attempt
landing, and the next morning were off Dyea,
where we were to go ashore. The surf was still
heavy, but the captain ventured out in a small boat
to get the scow in which passengers and goods
were generally conveyed to the shore; for the
water was shallow, and the steamer had to keep a
mile or so from the land. In the surf the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
capsized, and we could see the captain bobbing
up and down in the breakers, now on top, now under
his boat, in the icy water. The dishwasher,
who evidently knew the course of action in all
such emergencies from dime-novel precedents,
yelled out "Man the lifeboat!" The captain
had taken the only boat there was. The entire
crew, it may be mentioned, consisted, besides the
dishwasher and the captain, of the sailor, who
was also the cook. The duty of manning the
lifeboat&mdash;had there been one&mdash;would thus apparently
have devolved on the sailor, but he
grew pale and swore that he did not know how
to row and that he had just come from driving
a milk-wagon in San Francisco. A party of
prospectors became engaged in a heated discussion
as to whether, if there had been a boat on
board, it would not have been foolish to venture
out in it, even for the sake of trying to rescue the
captain; some urging the claims of heroism, and
others loudly proclaiming that they would not
risk <i>their</i> lives in any such d&mdash;&mdash;d foolish way as
that.</p>

<p>However, all this was only the froth and excitement
of the moment. The captain hauled his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
boat out of the breakers, skillfully launched it
again, and came on board, shivering but calm, a
strapping, reckless Cape Breton Scotch-Canadian.
In due course of time afterwards the scow was
also got out, and we transferred our outfits to it
and sat on top of them, while we were slowly
propelled ashore by long oars.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
OVER THE CHILKOOT PASS.</h2>


<p>At this time there was only one building
at Dyea&mdash;a log house used as a store for
trading with the natives, and known by the name
of Healy's Post. (Two years afterwards, on returning
to the place, I found a mushroom, sawed-board
town of several thousand people; but that
was after the Klondike boom.) We pitched our
tents near the shore that night, spreading our
blankets on the ground.</p>

<p>In the morning all were bustling around, following
out their separate plans for getting over
the Pass as soon as possible. Of the different
notches in the mountain wall by which one may
cross the coast range and arrive at the head
waters of the Yukon, the Chilkoot, which is
reached from Dyea, was at that time the only
one practicable. It was known that Jack Dalton,
a pioneer trader of the country, was wont to
go over the Chilkat Pass, a little further south,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
while Schwatka, Hayes, and Russell, in an expedition
of which few people ever heard, had
crossed by the way of the Taku River and the
Taku Pass to the Hootalinqua or Teslin River,
which is one of the important streams that unite
to make up the upper Yukon. But the White
Pass, which afterwards became the most popular,
and which lies just east of the Chilkoot, was at
that time entirely unused, being a rough long
trail that required clearing to make it serviceable.</p>

<p>The Chilkoot, though the highest and steepest
of the passes, was yet the shortest and the most
free from obstructions; it had been, before the
advent of the white adventurer in Alaska, the
avenue of travel for the handful of half-starved
interior natives who were wont to come down
occasionally to the coast, for the purpose of
trading. The coast Indians are, as they always
have been, a more numerous, more prosperous,
stronger and more quarrelsome class, for the sea
yielded them, directly and indirectly, a varied
and bountiful subsistence. The particular tribe
who occupied the Dyea region,&mdash;the Chilkoots&mdash;were
accustomed to stand guard over the Pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and to exact tribute from all the interior natives
who came in; and when the first white men appeared,
the natives tried in the same way to
hinder them from crossing and so destroying
their monopoly of petty traffic. For a short
time this really prevented individuals and small
parties from exploring, but in 1878 a party of
nineteen prospectors, under the leadership of
Edmund Bean, was organized, and to overcome
the hostility of the Chilkoots, a sort of military
"demonstration" was arranged by the officers in
charge at Sitka. The little gunboat stationed
there proceeded to Dyea, and, anchoring, fired a
few blank shots from her heaviest (or loudest)
guns; afterwards the officer in charge went on
shore, and made a sort of unwritten treaty or
agreement with the thoroughly frightened natives,
by which the prospectors, and all others
who came after, were allowed to proceed unmolested.</p>

<p>The fame of that "war-canoe" spread from
Indian to Indian throughout the length and
breadth of the vast territory of Alaska. One can
hear it from the natives in many places a thousand
miles from where the incident occurred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and each time the story is so changed and disguised,
that it might be taken for a myth by an
enthusiastic mythologist, and carefully preserved,
with all its vagaries, and very likely proved to
be an allegory of the seasons, or the travels of
the sun, moon, and stars. In proportion as the
story reached more and more remote regions, the
statements of the proportions of the canoe became
more and more exaggerated, and the
thunder of the guns more terrible, and the number
of warriors on board increased faster than
Jacob's flock. The gunboat was the butt for
many good-natured jokes from navy officers, on
account of her small dimensions and frail construction.
Yet the natives a little way into the
interior will tell you of the wonderful snow-white
war-canoe, half a mile long, armed with guns a
hundred yards or so in length; and by the time
one gets in the neighborhood of the Arctic Circle,
he will hear of the "great ship" (the native
will perhaps point to some mountain eight or ten
miles away) "as long as from here to the mountain";
how she vomited out smoke, fire and
ashes like a volcano, and at the same time exploded
her guns and killed many people, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
how she ran forwards and backwards, with the
wind or against it, at a terrific speed,&mdash;a formidable
monster, truly!</p>

<p>At the time of our trip (in 1896) the immigration
into the Yukon gold country had gone on,
in a small way, for some years; several mining
districts were well developed, and the natives
had settled down into the habit of helping the
white man, for a substantial remuneration.
These natives were all camped or housed close to
the shore. They were odd and interesting at
first sight. The men were of fair size, strong,
stolid, and sullen-looking; clothed in cheap civilized
garb in this summer season,&mdash;it was in the
early part of June&mdash;in overalls and jumpers, with
now and then a woollen Guernsey jacket, and
with straw hats on their heads. The women
were neither beautiful nor attractive. Many
of them had covered their faces with a mixture
of soot and grease, which stuck well. Other
women had their chins tattooed in stripes with
the indelible ink of the cuttlefish&mdash;sometimes
one, sometimes three, sometimes five or six
stripes. This custom I found afterwards among
the women of many tribes and peoples in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
parts of Alaska, and it seems, in some regions
at least, to be a mark of aristocracy, indicating
the wealth of the parents at the time the girl-child
was born. All the natives were living in
tents or rude wooden huts, in the most primitive
fashion, cooking by a smouldering fire outside,
and sleeping packed close together, wrapped in
skins and dirty blankets.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i042.jpg" width="600" height="455" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Alaskan Women and Children.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It had been the custom of the miners to engage
these natives to carry their outfits for them, from
Dyea, and some of the men who had come with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
us, immediately hired packers for the whole trip
to Lake Lindeman, paying them, I think, eleven
cents a pound for everything carried. The storekeeper,
however, had been constructing a foot
trail for about half the distance and had bought
a few pack-horses, and we engaged these to transport
our outfit as far as possible, trusting to Indians
for the rest. We had brought with us from
Juneau, on a last sudden idea, a lot of lumber
with which to build our boat when we should get
to Lake Lindeman, and here the transportation
of this lumber became a great problem. To pack
it on the horses was an impossibility, and the Indians
refused absolutely to take the boards unless
they were cut in two, which would destroy much
of their value, and even if this were done, demanded
an enormous price for the carrying;
therefore it was concluded to leave them behind,
and trust to good luck in the future.</p>

<p>In one way or another, everybody was furnished
with some kind of transportation, and the whole
visible population of Dyea, permanent or transient,
began moving up the valley. Some of the
natives put their loads in wooden dugout canoes,
which they paddled, or pushed with poles, six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
or seven miles up the small stream which goes
by the name of the Dyea River; others took
their packs on their backs, and led the way along
the trail. Not stronger, perhaps, than white men,
the Chilkoots showed themselves remarkably patient
and enduring, carrying heavy loads rapidly
long distances without resting. Not only the
men, but the women and children, made pack-animals
of themselves. I remember a slight boy of
thirteen or so, who could not have weighed over
eighty pounds, carrying a load of one hundred.
The dog belonging to the same family, a medium-sized
animal, waddled along with a load of about
forty pounds; he seemed to be imbued with the
same spirit as the rest, and although the load
nearly dragged him to the ground, he was patient
and persevering.</p>

<p>The trail was a tiresome one, being mostly
through loose sand and gravel alongside the
stream: several times we had to wade across.
As we went up, the valley became narrower, and
we had views of the glacier above us, which
reached long slender fingers down the little valleys
from the great ice-mass on the mountain.
It was evident that the glacier had once filled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
entire valley. As soon as we were up a little we
were obliged to clamber over the piled-up boulders
in the strips of moraine which the ice had left;
in places the rows were so regular that they had
the appearance of stone walls.</p>

<p>We were seized with fatigue and a terrible
hunger. "You haven't a sandwich about your
clothes, have you?" I asked of some prospectors
whom I overtook resting in the lee of a cliff.
Here the stream becomes so rough and rapid that
the natives can work their canoes no further, and
so the place has been somewhat pompously named
on some maps the "Head of Navigation," by
which most people infer that a gunboat may steam
up this far.</p>

<p>"No, by &mdash;&mdash;, pardner," was the answer, "if
we had, we'd a' eaten it ourselves before now."</p>

<p>Crossing the stream for the last time, on the
trunk of a fallen tree, which swayed alarmingly,
the trail led up steeply among the bare rocks of
the hillside. All the pedestrian groups had separated
into singles by this time, every one going
his "ain gait" according to his own ideas and
strength, and in no mood for conversation. I
overtook a young Irishman, who had started out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
with a pack of about seventy-five pounds; he was
resting, and quite downcast with fatigue and
hunger.</p>

<p>Just where we stopped some one had left a load
of canned corn and tomatoes. We eyed them
hungrily, and gravely discussed our rights to helping
ourselves. We did not know the owners and
could not find them&mdash;certainly they were none
of those that had come with us. We could not
take them and leave money, for although the natives
respected "caches" of provisions, we could
not expect them to do the same with money.
"Again," said the Irishman, "the feller what lift
them here may be dipinding on every blissed can
of swate corn for some little schayme of his,
while we have plenty grub of our own, if we can
on'y get our flippers on it."</p>

<p>At this period, all through Alaska, provisions
and other property was regarded with utmost respect.
Old miners and prospectors have told me
that they have left provisions exposed in a
"cache" for a year, and on returning after having
been hundreds of miles away, have found them
untouched, although nearly starving natives had
passed them almost daily all winter. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
mining camps the same custom prevailed. Locks
were unknown on the doors. When a white man
arrived at the hut of an absent prospector, he
helped himself, taking enough provisions from
the "cache" to keep him out of want, till he
could make the next stage of his journey, and
wrote on paper or on the wooden door, "I have
taken twenty pounds of flour, ten pounds of
bacon, five pounds of beans, and a little tea,"
signed his name, and departed. It was not a bill,
but an acknowledgment; and to have left without
making the acknowledgment constituted a
theft, in the eyes of the miner population. This
condition of primitive honesty did not last, however.
Later, with the Klondike boom, came the
ordinary light-fingeredness of civilization, and a
state of affairs unique and instructive passed
away.</p>

<p>We arrived finally at the end of the horse-trail,
a spot named Sheep Camp by an early
party of prospectors who killed some mountain
sheep here. Steep, rocky and snowy mountains
overhang the valley, with a vast glacier not far
up; and here, since our visit, have occurred a
number of fatal disasters, from snowslides and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
landslides. Pete had arrived before us: he had
set up a Yukon camp stove of sheet iron, had
kindled fire therein and was engaged in the
preparation of slapjacks and fried bacon, a sight
that affected us so that we had to go and sit
back to, and out of reach of the smell, till Pete
yelled out in vile Chinook "Muk-a-muk altay!
Bean on the table!" There were no beans and
no table, of course, but that was Pete's facetious
way of putting it.</p>

<p>Further than Sheep Camp the horse-trail was
quite too rocky and steep for the animals; so we
tried to engage Indians to take our freight for
the remaining part of the distance across the
Pass. Up to the time of our arrival, the regular
price for packing from Dyea to Lake Lindeman
had been eleven cents a pound. For the transportation
by horses over the first half of the distance&mdash;thirteen
miles&mdash;we had paid five cents a
pound, and we had expected to pay the Indians
six cents for the remainder of the trip. In the
first place, however, it was difficult to gather the
Indians together, for they were off in bands in
different parts of the neighboring country, on
expeditions of their own; and when they arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in Sheep Camp, with a bluster and a racket, they
were so set up by the number of men that were
waiting for their help that they took it into their
heads to be in no hurry about working. Finally
they sent a spokesman who, with an insolence
rather natural than assumed for the occasion, demanded
nine cents per pound instead of six, for
packing to Lake Lindeman. It was a genuine
strike&mdash;the revolt of organized labor against
helpless capital.</p>

<p>Being in a hurry to get ahead and fulfill
our mission, we should doubtless have yielded;
but there were many parties camped here
besides ourselves&mdash;namely, all those who had
been our fellow-sufferers on board the Scrambler&mdash;and
a general consultation being held
among the gold-hunters, it was decided that
the proposed increase of pay for labor would
prove ruinous to their business. A committee
representing these gentlemen waited on us and
begged us not to yield to the strikers, in the carelessness
of our hearts and our plethoric pocket-books,
but to consider that in doing so they&mdash;the
prospectors&mdash;must follow suit, the precedent being
once established; whereas they were poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
men, and could not afford the extra price. To
this view of the case we agreed, considering ourselves
as a part of the Sheep Camp community,
rather than as an individual party; and the
English traveller (who was likewise suspected of
being overburdened with funds, and therefore
likely to be careless with them) was also waited
upon and persuaded to resist the demands. So
everybody camped and waited, and was obstinate,
for several days: not only the white
men, but the Siwash.</p>

<p>By way of digression it may be mentioned that
the word Siwash is indiscriminately applied by
the white men to all the Alaskan natives, to
whatever race&mdash;and there are many&mdash;they belong.
The word therefore has no definite meaning,
but corresponds roughly to the popular
name of "nigger" for all very dark-skinned
races, or "Dago" for Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians,
Greeks, Turks, Armenians, and a host of
other black-haired, olive-skinned nations. The
name has been said to be a corruption of the
French word "sauvage,"&mdash;savage,&mdash;and this
seems very likely.</p>

<p>Like the corresponding epithets cited, the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Siwash has a certain familiar, facetious, and contemptuous
value, and this may have been the
idea which prompted its use just now, when
speaking of the natives as strikers and opponents.
At any rate, they took the situation in a careless,
matter-of-fact way; cooked, ate, slept, borrowed
our kettles, begged our tea and stole our sugar
with utmost cheerfulness, and were apparently
contented and happy. We white men likewise
tried to conceal our restlessness, and chatted in
each others' tents, admired the scenery, or went
rambling up the steep mountain-sides in search
of experiences, exercise, and rocks. Some of us
clambered over the huge boulders, each as big as
a New England cottage, which had been brought
here by glacial action, then up over the steep
cliffs, wrenched and crumbling from the crushing
of the same mighty force, supporting ourselves,&mdash;when
the rocks gave way beneath our
feet and went rattling down the cliff,&mdash;by the
tough saplings that had taken root in the crevices,
and grew out horizontally, or even inclined downwards,
bent by continuous snowslides. So we
reached the base of the glacier, where a sheer
wall of clear blue ice rose to a height which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
estimated at three or four hundred feet, back of
which stretched a great uneven white ice field,
as far as the eye could see, clear up till the view
was lost in the mists of the upper mountains;
an ice field seamed with great yawning crevasses,
where the blue of the ice gleamed as streaks on
the dead white.</p>

<p>One morning we heard a yell from the Siwash,
and soon they came running over the little knoll
which separated our camp from theirs, and began
grabbing the articles that belonged to some
of the miners. We were at a loss to know the
meaning of what seemed at first to be a very unceremonious
proceeding, but when we saw the
miners, with many shamefaced glances at us,
help the natives in the distribution of the material,
we realized that these men had forsaken
us and their resolutions; so greedy were they to
reach the land of gold that they had gone to the
natives and agreed to pay them the demanded
rates on condition that they should have all the
packers themselves, leaving none to us. We let
these men and their natives go in peace, without
even a reproach: less than a week afterwards we
had the deep satisfaction of passing them on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
trail, and even in lending them a hand in a series
of little difficulties for which, in their haste, they
had come unprepared. The veteran miner in
Alaska is a splendid, open-hearted, generous
fellow; the newcomer, or "chicharko," is a
thing to be avoided.</p>

<p>After this we had to wait till the natives had
got back from carrying the miners' supplies, and
then we agreed, with what grace we could, to
pay the price that the others had. The Indians
were quite a horde, capable of carrying in one
trip all the supplies belonging to our party and
that of the English traveller. Since they were
paid by the pound they vied in taking enormous
loads; the largest carried was 161 pounds, but
all the men's packs ranged from 125 to 150
pounds. Women and half-grown boys carried
packs of 100 pounds. It was a "Stick" or interior
Indian, named at the mission <i>Tom</i>, but
originally possessed of a fearful and unpronounceable
name, who carried the largest load.
He was barely tolerated and was somewhat
badgered by the Chilkoots, hence he fled much
to the society of the whites, and would squat
near for hours, always smiling horribly when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
looked at; he claimed to be a chief among his
own wretched people, and spent all his spare
time in blackening his face, reserving rings
around the eyes which he smeared with red
ochre&mdash;having done which, he grinned ghastly
approval of himself!</p>

<p>Pete started over the Pass in advance of the
party, to procure for us if possible a boat at
Lake Lindeman.</p>

<p>"Dis is dirt time I gross Pass," said Pete.
"Virst dime I dake leedle pack&mdash;den I vos blayed
out; nex' dime I dake leedle roll of clo'es&mdash;den
I vos blayed out too, py chimney: dis dime I
dake notting&mdash;den I vill be blayed out too!"</p>

<p>The natives, after much shouting and confusion
and wrangling, made up their packs about
noon, and started out, we following; just before
getting to snow-line they stopped in a place
where a chaotic mass of boulders form a trifling
shelter, grateful to wild beasts or wild men like
these. Here they deposited their loads, and
with exasperating indifference composed themselves
to sleep. We tried to persuade them to
go on, but to no avail, and we discovered afterwards,
as often happened to us in our dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
with the natives, that they were right. It was
June, and yet the snow lay deep on all the upper
parts of the Pass; and in the long, warm days
it became soft and mushy, making travel very
difficult, especially with heavy packs. As soon
as the sun went down behind the hills, however,
the air became cool, and a hard crust formed, so
that walking was much better.</p>

<p>We left the natives and followed a trail which
led among the boulders and then higher up the
mountain, where many moccasined feet had left
a deep path through the icy snow. We tramped
onward, sometimes on hard ice, sometimes
through soft snow, strung out in Indian file,
saying nothing, saving our breath for our lungs;
at times the crust rang hollow to our tread, and
beneath us we could hear torrents raging. It
was about eight o'clock at night when we
started, and the sun in the narrow valley had already
gone down behind the high glaciers on
the mountain-tops, even at this latitude and in
the month of June; so the long northern twilight
which is Alaska's substitute for night in
the summer months soon began to settle down
upon us. At the same time the moisture from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the snow which all day long had been lying in
the sun, began cooling into mists, changeful and
of different thicknesses; and in the dim light
gave to everything a weird and unnatural aspect.</p>

<p>Even our fellow-travellers were distorted and
magnified, now lengthwise, now sidewise, so
that those above us were powerful-limbed
giants, striding up the hill, while those behind
us were flattened and broadened, and seemed
straddling along as grotesquely as spiders.
When we drew near and looked at each other
we were inclined to laugh, but there was something
in the pale-blue, ghastly color of the faces
that made us stop, half-frightened. At twelve
o'clock it was so dark that we could hardly follow
the trail; then we saw a fire gleaming like
a will-o'-the-wisp somewhere above us, and clambering
up the steep rock which stuck out of the
snow and overhung the trail, we saw a couple of
figures crouching over a tiny blaze of twigs and
smoking roots. It was a native and his "klutchman"
or squaw; he turned out to be deaf-and-dumb,
but made signs to us,&mdash;as we squatted
ourselves around the fire,&mdash;that the night was
dark, the trail dangerous, and that it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
better to wait till it grew a little lighter. So we
kept ourselves warm for a half-hour or more by
our exertions in tearing up roots for a fire: the
fire itself being nothing more than a smoky, flary
pile of wet fagots, hardly enough to warm our
numbed fingers by. Then a dim figure came
toiling up to us. It was one of our packers, and
he explained in broken, profane, and obscene
English, of which he was very proud, (the foundation
of his knowledge had been laid in the mission,
and the trimmings, which were profuse and
with the same idea many times repeated, like an
art pattern, had been picked up from straggling
whites) that the trail was good now. So we
very gladly took up our march again.</p>

<p>Two of us soon got ahead of the guide and all
the rest of our party, following the beaten track
in the snow; after a while the ascent became very
steep, as the last sheer declivity of the Pass was
reached, and we began to suspect that we had
strayed from the right path, for although here
was a track, we could find no footprints on it,
but only grooves as if from things which had slid
down. Yet we decided not to go back, for we did
not know how far we had strayed from the path,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and the climbing was not so easy that we were
anxious to do it twice. So we kept on upward,
and the ascent soon became so steep that we
were obliged to stop and kick footholds in the
crust at every step.</p>

<p>It was twilight again, but still foggy, and we
could see neither up nor down, only what appeared
to be a vast chasm beneath us, wherein great indistinct
shapes were slowly shifting&mdash;an impression
infinitely more grand and appalling than the
reality. At any rate, it made us very careful in
every step, for we had no mind that a misplaced
foot should send us sliding down the grooves we
were following. At last we gained the top,
found here again the trail we had lost, and
waited for the rest. Around us, sticking out of
the snow, were rocks, which appeared distorted
and moving. It was the mists which moved past
them, giving a deceptive effect. My companion
suddenly exclaimed, "There's a bear!" On
looking, my imagination gave the shape the same
semblance, but on going towards it, it resolved
itself very reluctantly into a rock, as if ashamed
of its failure to "bluff." Most grown-up people,
as well as children, I fancy, are more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
afraid of the dark&mdash;where the uncertain evidence
of the eyes can be shaped by the imagination
into unnatural things. Goethe must once have
felt something like what Faust expressed when
he stood at night in one of the rugged Hartz
districts:</p>

<div class="poem">
"Seh' die Baüme hinter Baüme,<br />
Wie sie schnell vorüber rücken,<br />
Und die Klippen, die sich bücken,<br />
Und die langen Felsennasen,<br />
Wie sie schnarchen, wie sie blasen."<br />
</div>

<p>Presently the rest of the party came up from
quite a different direction and with them a whole
troop of packers. The main trail, from which
we had strayed, was much longer, but not so
steep; while the one we had followed was simply
the mark of the articles which the packers were
accustomed to send down from the summit to
save carrying, while they themselves took the
more circuitous route.</p>

<p>On the interior side of the summit is a small
lake with steep sides, which the miners have
named Crater Lake, fancying from the shape
that it had been formed by volcanic action; it
has no such origin however, but occupies what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
known as a glacial cirque or amphitheatre&mdash;a
deep hollow carved out of the dioritic mountain
mass by the powerful wearing action of a valley
glacier. This lake was still frozen and we
crossed on the ice, then followed down the valley
of the stream which flowed from it and led
into another small lake. There are several of
these small bodies of water and connecting
streams before one reaches Lake Lindeman,
which is several miles long, and is the uppermost
water of the Yukon which is navigable for boats.
Our path was devious, following the packers, but
always along this valley. We crossed and recrossed
the streams over frail and reverberant
arches, half ice, half snow, which, already broken
away in places, showed foaming torrents beneath.
As we descended in elevation, the ice on
the little lakes became more and more rotten and
the snow changed to slush, through which we
waded knee deep for miles, sometimes putting a
foot through the ice into the water beneath.</p>

<p>We were all very tired by this time and were
separated from one another by long distances,
each silent, and travelling on his nerve. The
Indian packers, too, in spite of their long experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
were tired and out of temper; but the
most pitiful sight of all was to see the women,
especially the old ones, bending under crushing
loads, dragging themselves by sheer effort at
every step, groaning and stopping occasionally,
but again driven forward by the men to whom
they belonged. One could not interfere; it was
a family matter; and as among white people, the
woman would have resented the interference as
much as the man.</p>

<p>Finally we came to a lake where the water
was almost entirely open and were obliged to
skirt along its rocky shores to where we found a
brawling and rocky stream entering it, cutting
us off. After a moment of vain glancing up and
down in search of a ford, we took to the water
bravely, floundering among the boulders on the
stream's bottom, and supporting ourselves somewhat
with sticks. Afterwards we found a trail
which led away from the lake high over the rocky
hillside, where the rocks had been smoothed and
laid bare by ancient glaciers, now vanished.
Here we found the remnants of a camp, left
by some one who had recently gone before us;
we inspected the corned beef cans lying about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
rather hungrily, thinking that something might
have been left over. Our only lunch since
leaving Sheep Camp had been a small piece of
chocolate and a biscuit. The biscuit possessed
certain almost miraculous qualities, to which I ascribe
our success in completing the trip and in arriving
first among the travellers at Lake Lindeman.
I myself was the concocter of this biscuit,
but it was done in a moment of inspiration, and
since I have forgotten certain mystic details, it
probably could never be gotten together again.
It was the first and last time that I have made
biscuit in my life, and I did it simply for the
purpose of instruction to the others, who were
shockingly ignorant of such practical matters.</p>

<p>We had brought a reflector with us for baking,&mdash;a
metal arrangement which is set up in front
of a camp-fire, and, from polished metallic surfaces,
reflects the heat up and down, on to a pan
of biscuit or bread, which is slid into the middle.
These utensils as used in the Lake Superior
region, that home of good wood-craft, are made
of sheet iron, tinned; but thinking to get a
lighter article, I had one constructed out of
aluminum. This first and last trial with our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
aluminum reflector at Sheep Camp showed us
that one of the peculiar properties of this metal
is that it reflects heat but very little, but transmits
it, almost as readily as glass does light. So
when I had arrived at the first stage of my
demonstration and had the reflector braced up
in front of the fire, I found that the dough remained
obstinately dough, while the heat passed
through the reflector and radiated itself around
about Sheep Camp. Still I persisted, and after
several hours of stewing in front of the fire, most
of the water was evaporated from the dough,
leaving a compact rubbery grey <span class="smcap">BISCUIT</span>, as I
termed it. I offered it for lunch and I ate one
myself; no one else did, but I was rewarded by
feeling a fullness all through the tramp, while
the others were empty and famished. I also was
sure that it gave me enormous strength and endurance;
while some of the rest were unkind
enough to suggest that the same high courage
which led me up to the biscuit's mouth, figuratively
speaking, kept me plugging away on the
Lake Lindeman trail.</p>

<p>We reached Lake Lindeman at about nine
o'clock in the morning, and found Pete and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Cooper already there. It was raining drearily
and they had made themselves a shelter of poles
and boughs under which they were lying contentedly
enough, waiting until the packers should
bring the tents. In a very short time after we
had arrived all the natives were at hand, and setting
down their packs demanded money. They
could not be induced to accept bills, because they
could not tell the denomination of them, and
would as soon take a soap advertisement as a
hundred-dollar note; they dislike gold, because
they get so small a quantity of it in comparison
with silver.</p>

<p>Like the Indians of the United States, the
Alaskans formerly used wampum largely as a
medium of exchange&mdash;small, straight, horn-shaped,
rather rare shells, which were strung on
thongs&mdash;but when the trading companies began
shipping porcelain wampum into the country the
natives soon learned the trick and stopped the
use of it. I have in my possession specimens of
this porcelain wampum, which I got from the
agent of one of the large trading companies on
the Yukon. Silver is now the favorite currency,
whether or not on the basis of sound political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
economy; and each particular section has often
a preference for some special coin, such as a
quarter, ("two bits," as it is called in the language
of the west coast) a half-dollar or a dollar.
Where the natives have had to deal only with
quarters, you cannot buy anything for half-dollars,
except for nearly double the price you
would pay in quarters; while dimes, however large
the quantity, would probably be refused entirely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Alaskan Indians and House.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chilkoots, however, on account of their
residence on the coast and consequent contact
with the whites, had become more liberal in
their views as regarded denomination of silver,
but drew the line at bimetalism, and had no
faith whatsoever in the United States as the fulfiller
of promises to redeem greenbacks in silver
coin. So there was some trouble in paying them
satisfactorily; and after they were paid they
came back, begging for a little flour, a little tea,
etc., and keeping up the process with unwearied
ardor till the supply was definitely shut off.
The toughness of these people is well shown by
the fact that when they had rested an hour and
had cooked themselves a little food and drunk a
little tea, they departed over the trail again for
Sheep Camp, although they had made the same
journey as the white men, who were all exhausted,
and had, in addition, carried loads of as
high as 160 pounds over the whole of the
rough trail of thirteen miles. When affairs were
settled we pitched our tents, rolled into our
blankets, and for the next twenty hours slept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
THE LAKES AND THE YUKON TO FORTY MILE.</h2>


<p>Upon reaching Lake Lindeman, we found a
number of other parties encamped,&mdash;men
who had come over the trail before us, and had
been delaying a short time, for different reasons.
From one of these parties Pete had been lucky
enough to buy a boat already built, so that we
did not have to wait and build one ourselves&mdash;a
job that would have consumed a couple of weeks.
The boat was after the dory pattern, but sharp at
both ends, made of spruce, lap-streaked and unpainted,
with the seams calked and pitched;
about eighteen feet long, and uncovered. During
the trip later we decided that it ought to be
christened, and so we mixed some soot and
bacon-grease for paint, applied it hot to the
raw, porous wood, and inscribed in shaky letters
the words "<i>Skookum Pete</i>," as a compliment to
our pilot. <i>Skookum</i> is a Chinook word signifying
strength, courage, and other excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
qualities necessary for a native, a frontiersman,
or any other dweller in the wilderness&mdash;qualities
which were conspicuous in Pete. Pete was overcome
with shame on reading the legend, however,
and straightway erased his name, so that
she was simply the <span class="smcap">Skookum</span>. And skookum
she proved herself, in the two thousand miles we
afterwards travelled, even though she sprung
a leak occasionally or became obstinate when being
urged up over a rapid.</p>

<p>It may be observed that the Chinook, to which
this word belongs, is not a language, but a
jargon, composed of words from many native
American and also from many European
tongues. It sprung up as a sort of universal
language, which was used by the traders of the
Hudson Bay Company in their intercourse with
the natives, and is consequently widely known,
but is poor in vocabulary and expression.</p>

<p>There were several boats ready to start, craft
of all models and grades of workmanship, variously
illustrating the efforts of the cowboy, the
clerk, or the lawyer, at ship-carpentry. Several
of us got off together in the morning, our boat
carrying four, and the English traveller's boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the same number, for he had taken into his party
the priest whom we had met on the Scrambler.</p>

<p>This gentleman, with a number of miners and
a newspaper reporter, had been unlucky enough
to fall into the trap of a certain transportation
company, which had a very prettily furnished
office in Seattle. This office was the big end of
the company. As one went north towards the
region where the company was supposed to be
doing its transportation, it shrunk till nothing
was left but a swindle. They promised for a
certain sum of money to transport supplies and
outfits over the Pass, and to have the entire expedition
in charge of an experienced man, who
would relieve one of all worry and bother; and
after transportation across the Pass, to put their
passengers on the <span class="smcap">COMPANY'S</span> steamers, which
would carry them to the gold fields. Even at
Juneau the "experienced man" who was to take
the party through, and who was a high officer of
the company, kept up the ridiculous pretences
and succeeded in obtaining a number of passengers
for the trip. When these men learned
later, however, that the guide had never yet
been further than Juneau; that he had no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of transporting freight over the Pass; that the
steamers existed only in fancy; and finally,
when opportunity to hire help offered, that the
leader had no funds, so that they were obliged
to do all the work themselves, in order to move
along: when they learned all this they were
naturally a disgusted set of men, but having
now given away their money, most of them decided
to stick together till the diggings were
reached. The priest, however, who was in a
hurry, became nervous when he saw different
parties leaving the rapid and elegant transportation
company in the rear, and effected a separation.</p>

<p>When we left Sheep Camp, the manager was
trying to cajole his passengers into carrying their
own packs to the summit, even going so far as to
take little loads himself&mdash;"just for exercise," as
he airily informed us. He was an Englishman,
of aristocratic tendencies, with an awe-inspiring
acquaintance with titles. "You know Lord Dudson
Dudley, of course," he would begin, fixing
one with his eye as if to hypnotize; "his sister,
you remember, made such a row by her flirtation
with Sir Jekson Jekby.&mdash;Never heard of them?&mdash;Humph!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
And then with a look which seemed
to say "What kind of a blarsted Philistine is
this?" he would retreat to his own camp-fire.</p>

<p>We sailed down Lake Lindeman with a fair
brisk wind, using our tent-fly braced against a
pole, for a sail. The distance is only four or five
miles, so that the lower end of the lake was
reached in an hour. A mountain sheep was
sighted on the hillside above us, soon after starting,
and a long-range shot with the rifle was tried
at it, but the animal bounded away.</p>

<p>At the lower end of this first of the Yukon
navigable lakes there is a stream, full of little
falls and rapids, which connects with Lake Bennett,
a much larger body of water. According to
Pete, the boat could not run these rapids, so we
began the task of "lining" her down. With a
long pole shod with iron, especially brought along
for such work, Pete stood in the bow or stern, as
the emergency called for, planting the pole on
the rocks which stuck out of the water and so
shoving and steering the boat through an open
narrow channel, while we three held a long line
and scrambled along the bank or waded in the
shallow water. We had put on long rubber boots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
reaching to the hip and strapped to our belts, so at
first our wading was not uncomfortable. On account
of the roar of the water we could not hear
Pete's orders, but could see his signals to "haul
in," or "let her go ahead." On one difficult little
place he man&oelig;uvered quite a while, getting stuck
on a rock, signalling us to pull back, and then trying
again. Finally he struck the right channel,
and motioned energetically to us to go ahead.
We spurted forward, waddling clumsily, and the
foremost man stepped suddenly into a groove
where the water was above his waist. Ugh! It
was icy, but he floundered through, half swimming,
half wading, dragging his great water-filled
boots behind him like iron weights; and the rest
followed. We felt quite triumphant and heroic
when we emerged, deeming this something of a
trial: we did not know that the time would come
when it would be the ordinary thing all day long,
and would become so monotonous that all feelings
of novelty would be lost in a general neutral tint
of bad temper and rheumatism.</p>

<p>On reaching shallow water the weight of the
water-filled rubber boots was so great that we
could no longer navigate among the slippery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
rocks, so we took turns going-ashore and emptying
them. There was a smooth round rock with
steep sides, glaring in the sun; on this we stretched
ourselves head down, so that the water ran out
of our boots and trickled in cold little streams
down our backs; then we returned to our
work.</p>

<p>Before undertaking to line the Skookum through
the rapids we had taken out a large part of the
load and put it on shore, in order to lighten the
boat, and also to save our "grub" in case our
boat was capsized. The next task was to carry
this over the half-mile portage. Packing is about
the hardest and most disliked work that a pioneer
has to do, and yet every one that travels hard
and well in Alaska and similar rough countries
must do it <i>ad nauseam</i>. In such remote and unfinished
parts of the world transportation comes
back to the original and simple phase,&mdash;carrying
on one's back. The railroad and the steamboat
are for civilization, the wheeled vehicle for the
inhabited land where there are roads, the camel
for the desert, the horse for the plains and where
trails have been cut, but for a large part of
Alaska Nature's only highways are the rivers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and when the water will not carry the burdens
the explorer must.</p>

<p>In a properly-constructed pack-sack, the weight
is carried partly by the shoulders but mainly by
the neck, the back being bent and the neck
stretched forward till the load rests upon the back
and is kept from slipping by the head strap, which
is nearly in line with the rigid neck. An astonishing
amount can be carried in this way with
practice,&mdash;for half a mile or so, very nearly one's
own weight. Getting up and down with such a
load is a work of art, which spoils the temper and
wrenches the muscles of the beginner. Having
got into the strap he finds himself pinned to the
ground in spite of his backbone-breaking efforts
to rise, so he must learn to so sit down in the beginning
that he can tilt the load forward on his
back, get on his hands and knees and then elevate
himself to the necessary standing-stooping posture;
or he must lie down flat and roll over on
his face, getting his load fairly between his
shoulders, and then work himself up to his hands
and knees as before. Sometimes, if the load is
heavy, the help of another must be had to get
an upright position, and then the packer goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
trudging off, red and sweating and with bulging
veins.</p>

<p>By the time we had carried our outfits over
the portage, we were ready for supper, and after
that for a sleep. We pitched no tent&mdash;we were
too tired, and the blue sky and the still shining
sun looked very friendly&mdash;so we rolled in our
blankets and slumbered.</p>

<p>There were other craft than ours at Lake Bennett,&mdash;belonging
to parties who had come over
before us, and who had not yet started. The
most astonishing thing was a small portable
sawmill, which had been pulled across the Chilkoot
Pass in the winter, over the snow and ice;
and the limited means of communication in this
country are well shown by the fact that no news
of any such mill was to be had anywhere along
the route. Men went over the Chilkoot Pass
into the interior, but rarely any came back that
way.</p>

<p>Among the gold hunters was a solitary Dutchman,
a pathetic, desperate, mild-mannered sort
of an adventurer, who had built himself a boat
like a wood-box in model and construction,
square, lop-sided, and leaky; but he started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
bravely down Lake Bennett, paddling, with a
rag of a square-sail braced against a pole. We
pitied, admired, and laughed at him, but many
were the doubts expressed as to whether he
could reach the diggings in his cockle-shell.
Then there was a large scow, also frailly built;
this contained several tons of outfit, and a party
of seven or eight men and one woman. They
were the parasites of the mining camp, all ready,
with smuggled whisky and faro games&mdash;Wein,
Weib, und Gesang&mdash;to relieve the miners of
some of their gold-dust: and I am told that the
manager of the expedition brought out $100,000
two years later.</p>

<p>We all got away, one after the other. There
was a stiff fair wind blowing down the lake,
which soon increased to a gale, and the waves
became very rough. The lake is narrow and
fjord-like, walled in by high mountains which
often rise directly from the shores. Lakes like
this all through Alaska are naturally subject
to frequent and violent gales, since the deep
mountain valleys form a kind of chimney, up
and down which the currents of air rush to the
frosty snowy mountains from the warmer lowlands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
or in the opposite direction. The further
we went the harder the wind blew, and the
rougher became the water, so that when about
half-way down we made a landing to escape a
heavy squall. After dinner, it seemed from our
snug little cove that the wind had abated, and
we put out again. On getting well away from
the sheltering shore we found it rougher than
ever; but while we were at dinner we had seen
the scow go past, its square bow nearly buried
in foaming water, and had seen it apparently
run ashore on the opposite side of the lake, some
miles further down. Once out, therefore, we
steered for the place where the scow had been
beached, for the purpose of giving aid if any
were necessary. On the run over we shipped
water repeatedly over both bow and stern, and
sometimes were in imminent danger of swamping,
but by skillful managing we gained the
shelter of a little nook about half a mile from
the open beach where the scow was lying, and
landed. We then walked along the shore to the
scow, and found its passengers all right, they
having beached voluntarily, on account of the
roughness of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>However, we had had enough navigation for
one day, so we did not venture out again. Presently
another little boat came scudding down
the lake through the white, frothy water, and
shot in alongside the Skookum. It was a party
of miners&mdash;the young Irishman whom I had
overtaken on the trail to Sheep Camp, and his
three "pardners."</p>

<p>It was not an ideal spot where we all camped,
being simply a steep rocky slope at the foot of
cliffs. When the time came to sleep we had
difficulty in finding places smooth enough to lie
down comfortably, but finally all were scattered
around here and there in various places of concealment
among the rocks. I had cleared a
space close under a big boulder, of exactly my
length and breadth (which does not imply any
great labor), and with my head muffled in the
blankets, was beginning to doze, when I heard
stealthy footsteps creeping toward me. As I
lay, these sounds were muffled and magnified in
the marvellous quiet of the Alaskan night (although
the sun was still shining), so that I could
not judge of the size and the distance of the animal.
Soon it got quite close to me, and I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
hear it scratching at something; then it seemed
to be investigating my matches, knife and compass.
Finally, wide-awake, and somewhat startled,
I sat up suddenly and threw my blanket
from my face, and looked for the marauding
animal. I found him&mdash;in the shape of a saucy
little grey mouse, that stared at me in amazement
for a moment, and then scampered into his
hole under the boulder. As I had no desire to
have the impudent little fellow lunching on me
while I slept, I plugged the hole with stones
before I lay down again. Some of the same
animals came to visit Schrader in his bedchamber,
and nibbled his ears so that they were
sore for some time.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>As the gale continued all the next day without
abatement, we profited by the enforced delay
to climb the high mountain which rose precipitously
above us. And apropos of this climb, it is
remarkable what difference one finds in the appearance
of a bit of country when simply surveyed
from a single point and when actually
travelled over. Especially is this true in mountains.
Broad slopes which appear to be perfectly
easy to traverse are in reality cut up by narrow
and deep canyons, almost impossible to cross;
what seems to be a trifling bench of rock, half a
mile up the mountain, grows into a perpendicular
cliff a hundred feet high before one reaches it;
and pretty grey streaks become gulches filled
with great angular rock fragments, so loosely
laid one over the other that at each careful step
one is in fear of starting a mighty avalanche,
and of being buried under rock enough to build
a city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to difficulties like these it was near
supper-time when we gained the top of the main
mountain range. As far as the eye could see in
all directions, there rose a wilderness of barren
peaks, covered with snow; while in one direction
lay a desolate, lifeless table-land, shut in by high
mountains. Below and near us lay gulches and
canyons of magnificent depth, and the blue
waters of one of the arms of Lake Bennett appeared,
just lately free from ice. Above, rose a
still higher peak, steep, difficult of access, and
covered with snow; this the lateness of the hour
prevented us from attempting to climb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day and the next the wind was as high
as ever; but the waiting finally became too
tedious, and we started out, the four miners having
preceded us by a half an hour. Once out of
the shelter of the projecting point, we found the
gale very strong and the chop disagreeable. We
squared off and ran before the wind for the opposite
side of the lake, driving ahead at a good
rate under our little rag of a sail. Although the
boat was balanced as evenly as possible, every
minute or two we would take in water, sometimes
over the bow, sometimes in the stern,
sometimes amidships. I have in my mind a very
vivid picture of that scene: Wiborg in the stern,
steering intently and carefully; Goodrich and
Schrader forward, sheets in hand, attending to
the sail; and myself stretched flat on my face, in
order not to make the boat top-heavy, and bailing
out the water with a frying-pan. On nearing
the lower shore we noticed that the boat
containing the miners had run into the breakers,
and presently one of the men came running
along the beach, signaling to us. Fearing that
they were in trouble, we made shift to land, although
it was no easy matter on this exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
shore; and we then learned that they had kept
too near the beach, had drifted into the breakers
and had been swamped, but had all safely
landed. Three of our party went to give assistance
in hauling their boat out of the water,
while I remained behind to fry the bacon for
dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner we concluded to wait again before
attempting the next stage; so we picked
out soft places in the sand and slumbered.
When we awoke we found the lake perfectly
smooth and calm, and lost no time in getting
under way. On this day we depended for our
motive power solely on our oars, and we found
the results so satisfactory that we kept up the
practice hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>Below Lake Bennett came Tagish Lake, beautiful
and calm. Its largest fjord-like arm is famous
for its heavy gales, whence it has been
given the name of "Windy Arm"; but as we
passed it we could hardly distinguish the line of
division between the mountains in the air and
those reflected in the lake, so completely at rest
was the water. At the lower part, where we
camped, we found the first inhabitants since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
leaving the coast, natives belonging to the Tagish
tribe. They are a handful of wretched, half-starved
creatures, who scatter in the summer
season for hunting and fishing, but always return
to this place, where they have constructed rude
wooden habitations for winter use. We bought
here a large pike, which formed an agreeable
change from bacons, beans, and slapjacks.</p>

<p>While camped at this place we met an old man
and his two sons, who had brought horses into
the country some months before, with some
crazy idea of taking up land for farming purposes,
or of getting gold. The old man had
been taken sick, and all three were now on their
way out, having abandoned their horses on the
Hootalinqua. All three were thin and worn,
and agreed if they ever got out of the country
they would not come back. The old man begged
for a little tea, which we supplied him, together
with a few other things; he insisted on our taking
pay for them, with the pathetic pride of a
man broken in health and fortune, but we understood
the pioneer custom well enough to know
we should give no offence by refusing.</p>

<p>After passing out of this lake we entered another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
appropriately called by the miners "Mud
Lake"; it is very shallow, with muddy bottom
and shores. Here we found camping disagreeable,
for on account of the shallowness we could
not bring our heavily laden boat quite to the
shore, but were obliged to wade knee deep in
soft mud for a rod or two before finding even
moderately solid ground.</p>

<p>About this time we experienced the first sharp
taste of the terrible Alaskan mosquito&mdash;or it
might be more correct to reverse the statement,
and say that the mosquitoes had their first taste
of us. At the lower end of Tagish Lake they suddenly
attacked us in swarms, and remained with
us steadily until near the time of our departure
from the Territory. We had heard several times
of the various hardships to be encountered in
Alaska, but, as is often the case, we found that
these accounts had left a rather unduly magnified
image of the difficulties in our imaginations, as
compared with our actual experiences. In this
generalization the mosquito must be excepted. I
do not think that any description or adjective
can exaggerate the discomfort and even torture
produced by these pests, at their worst, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
stand peerless among their kind, so far as my experience
goes, and that of others with whom I
have spoken, for wickedness unalloyed.</p>

<p>We were driven nearly frantic when they attacked
us and quickly donned veils of netting,
fastened around the hat and buttoned into the
shirt, and gauntleted cavalry gloves; but still the
heat of rowing and the warmth of the sun made
the stings smart till we could hardly bear it.
From time to time I glanced at Pete, who sat in
the stern, steering with a paddle, his face and
hands unprotected, his hat pushed back, trolling
his favorite song.</p>

<div class="poem">
"And none was left to tell me, Tom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And few was left to know</span><br />
Who played upon the village green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just twenty year ago!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>I admired him beyond expression. "How long,"
thought I, "does one have to stay in Alaska before
one gets so indifferent to mosquitoes as this? Or
is it simply the phlegm of the Norwegian&mdash;magnificent
in mosquito time?" Just then Pete
broke in his song and began a refrain of curses
in Norwegian and English and some other languages&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
apropos of mosquitoes. He averred
emphatically that never&mdash;no, never&mdash;had he seen
mosquitoes quite so disagreeable. This lasted
about five minutes; then he settled down to a
calm again. I perceived that men's tempers may
be something like geysers&mdash;some keep bubbling
hot water continually, while others, like Pete's,
keep quiet for a while and then explode violently.</p>

<p>It seems strange to many that a country like
Alaska, sub-Arctic in climate, should be so burdened
with a pest which we generally associate
with hot weather and tropical swamps. But the
long warm days of summer in these high latitudes
seem to be extraordinarily favorable to all
kinds of insect life&mdash;mosquitoes, gnats, and flies&mdash;which
harbor in the moss and dense underbrush.
Other countries similarly situated, such
as the region between the Gulf of Bothnia and
the Arctic Ocean&mdash;Northern Finland&mdash;which is
north of the Arctic Circle, are also pestered
with mosquitoes during the summer months.</p>

<p>In Alaska the mosquitoes are so numerous that
they occupy a large part of men's attention, and
form the subject for much conversation as long as
they remain&mdash;and they are astonishing stayers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
appearing before the snow is gone and not leaving
until the nights grow comparatively long and
frosty. They flourish as well in cool weather
as in hot, thawing cheerfully out after a heavy
frost and getting to work as if to make up for
lost time. We were able to distinguish at least
three species: a large one like those met at the
seaside resorts, which buzzes and buzzes and
buzzes; then a smaller one that buzzes a little
but also bites ferociously; and, worst of all,
little striped fellows who go about in great
crowds. These last never stop to buzz, but come
straight for the intruder on a bee-line, stinging
him almost before they reach him&mdash;and their
sting is particularly irritating. Many stories
have been told of the mosquitoes in Alaska; one
traveller tells how bears are sometimes killed
by these pests, though this story is probably an
exaggeration. But men who are travelling
must have veils and gloves as protection against
them. Even the natives wrap their heads in
skins or cloth, and are overjoyed at any little
piece of mosquito-netting they can get hold of.
With the best protection, however, one cannot
help being tormented and worn out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>We always slept with gloves and veils on, and
with our heads wrapped as tightly as possible,
yet the insects would crawl through the crevices
of the blankets and sting through the clothes, or
where the veil pressed against the face,&mdash;not one,
but hundreds&mdash;so that one slept but fitfully and
woke to find his face bloody and smarting, and
would at once make for the cold river water,
bathing hands and face to relieve the pain, and
dreading to keep his veil up long enough to gobble
his breakfast.</p>

<p>The climate of this interior country is dry, and
the rains infrequent. We worked so long during
the day that we seldom took the trouble to pitch
a tent at night, but lay down with our backs
against some convenient log, so that the mosquitoes
had a good chance at us. Even in the
day, when protected by veil and gloves, I have
been so irritated by them as to run until breathless
to relieve my excitement, and I can readily
believe, as has been told, that a man lost in the
underbrush without protection, would very soon
lose his reason and his life. As soon as the country
is cleared up or burned over, the scourge becomes
much less, so that in the mining camps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
annoyance is comparatively slight. Mosquitoes
are popularly supposed to seek and feed upon
men, while the reverse is true. They avoid men,
swarming most in thick underbrush and swamps
which are difficult of access, and disappearing
almost entirely as soon as the axe and the plow
and other implements in the hands of man invade
their solitudes.</p>

<p>Out of Mud Lake we floated into the river
again, and slipped easily down between the sandbanks.
Ducks and geese were plentiful along
here, and we practised incessantly on them with
the rifle, without, however, doing any noticeable
execution. On the second day we knew we
must be near the famous canyon of the Lewes;
and one of our party was put on watch, in
order that we might know its whereabouts before
the swift current should sweep us into it,
all heavily laden as we were. The rest of us
rowed and steered, and admired the beautiful
tints of the hills, which now receded from
the river, now came close to it. Presently we
heard a gentle snore from the lookout who was
comfortably settled among the flour sacks in the
bow; this proved to us that our confidence had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
been misplaced, and all hands became immediately
alert. Soon after, we noticed a bit of red
flannel fluttering from a tree projecting over the
bank, doubtless a part of some traveller's shirt
sacrificed in the cause of humanity; and by the
time we had pulled in to the shore we could see
the waters of the river go swirling and roaring
into a sudden narrow canyon with high, perpendicular
walls.</p>

<p>We found the parties of miners already landed,
and presently, as we waited on the bank and
reconnoitered, Danlon's party came up, and not
long after, the barge, so that we were about
twenty in all. Wiborg, and Danlon's guide,
Cooper, were the only ones that had had experience
in this matter, so all depended on their
judgment, and waited to see the results of their
efforts before risking anything themselves.</p>

<p>In former years all travellers made a portage
around this very difficult place, hauling their
boats over the hill with a rude sort of a windlass;
but a man having been accidentally sucked
into the canyon came out of the other end all
right, which emboldened others. In this case
Wiborg and Cooper decided that the canyon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
could be run, although the water was very high
and turbulent; and they thought best to run
the boats through themselves. Our own boat
was selected to be experimented with; most of
the articles that were easily damageable by water
were taken out, leaving perhaps about eight
hundred pounds. I went as passenger sitting in
the bow, while the two old frontiersmen managed
paddles and oars. Rowing out from the shore
we were immediately sucked into the gorge, and
went dashing through at a rate which I thought
could not be less than twenty miles an hour. So
great is the body of water confined between
these perpendicular walls, and so swift is the
stream, that its surface becomes convex, being
considerably higher in the centre of the channel
than on the sides. Waves rushing in every direction
are also generated, forming a puzzling
chop. Two or three of these waves presently
boarded us, so that I was thoroughly wet, and
then came a broad glare of sunlight as we
emerged from the first half of the canyon into a
sort of cauldron which lies about in its centre.</p>

<p>Here we were twisted about by eddying
currents for a few seconds, and then precipitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
half sidewise into the canyon again. The latter
half turned out to be the rougher part, and our
bow dipped repeatedly into the waves, till I
found myself sitting in water, and the bow,
where most of the water remained, sagged
alarmingly. It seemed as if another ducking
would sink us. This fortunately we did not get,
but steered safely through the final swirl to
smooth water. During all this trip I had not
looked up once, although as we shot by we heard
faintly a cheer from the rocks above, where our
companions were.</p>

<p>Next day, after a night made almost unbearable
by mosquitoes, we rose to face the difficulties
of White Horse Rapids, which lie below the
canyon proper, and are still more formidable.
Here the river contracts again, and is confined
between perpendicular walls of basalt. The
channel is full of projecting rocks, so that the
whole surface is broken, and there are many
strong conflicting currents and eddies. At the
end of these rapids, which extend for a quarter
of a mile or so, is a narrow gorge in the rocks,
through which the whole volume of water is
forced. This is said to be only twenty or thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
feet wide, although at the time of our passing
the water was sufficiently high to flow over the
top of the enclosing walls, thus concealing the
actual width of the chute. Through this the
water plunges at a tremendous velocity&mdash;probably
thirty miles an hour&mdash;forming roaring, foaming,
tossing, lashing waves which somehow make
the name White Horse seem appropriate.</p>

<p>Above the beginning of the rapid we unloaded
our boat, and carefully lowered it down by
ropes, keeping it close to the shore, and out of
the resistless main current. After having safely
landed it, with considerable trouble, below the
chute, we carried our outfit (about twelve hundred
pounds) to the same point. Danlon's boat
and that belonging to the miners were safely
gotten through in the same way, all hands helping
in turn.</p>

<p>When it came to the scow, it was the general
opinion that it would be impossible to lower it
safely, for its square shape gave the current such
a grip that it seemed as if no available strength
of rope or man could hold out against it. As
carrying the boat was out of the question, the
only alternative was to boldly run it through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
rapids, in the middle of the channel; and this
naturally hazardous undertaking was rendered
more difficult by the frail construction of the
scow, which had been built of thin lumber by
unskilled hands. The scow's crew did not care
to make the venture themselves, but finally prevailed
upon Wiborg and Cooper to make the
trial.</p>

</div>

<p>Reflecting that at any time I might be placed
in similar difficulties, in this unknown country,
and thrown upon my own resources, I resolved
to accompany them, for the sake of finding out
how the thing was done; but I was ruled out of
active service by Wiborg, who, however, consented
finally to my going along as passenger.
Two of the scow's own crew were drafted to act
as oarsmen, and we pushed out, Cooper steering,
and Wiborg in the bow, iron-shod pole in hand,
fending off from threatening rocks; and in a
second we were dancing down the boiling rapids
and tossing hither and thither like a cork. I sat
facing the bow, opposite the oarsmen, who
tugged frantically away, white as death; behind
me Cooper's paddle flashed and twisted rapidly,
as we dodged by rocks projecting from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
water, sometimes escaping only by a few inches,
where a collision would have smashed us to
chips. The rest of the party, waiting below the
chute, said that sometimes they saw only the
bottom of the scow, and sometimes looked down
upon it as if from above. As we neared the end,
Cooper's skillful paddle drove us straight for the
centre, where the water formed an actual fall;
this central part was the most turbulent, but the
safest, for on either side, a few feet away, there
was danger of grazing the shallow underlying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
rocks. As we trembled on the brink, I looked
up and saw our friends standing close by, looking
much concerned. A moment later there was
a dizzying plunge, a blinding shower of water, a
sudden dashing, too swift for observation, past
rock walls, and then Wiborg let out an exultant
yell&mdash;we were safe. At that instant one of the
oarsmen snapped his oar, an accident which
would have been serious a moment before. On
the shore below the rapids we found flour-sacks,
valises, boxes and splintered boards, mementoes
of poor fellows less lucky than ourselves.</p>

<p>We camped at the mouth of the Tahkeena
River that night, and arrived the next day at
Lake Labarge, the last and longest of the series.
When we reached it, at one o'clock, the water
was calm and smooth; and although it was
nearly forty miles across, we decided to keep on
without stopping till we reached the other side,
for fear of strong winds such as had delayed us
on Lake Bennett. Danlon's party concluded to
do the same, and so we rowed steadily all night,
after having rowed all day.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning a favorable
wind sprung up suddenly, and increased to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
gale. At this time we became separated from
the other boats, which kept somewhat close to
the shore, while we, with our tiny sail, stood
straight across the lake for the outlet. As soon
as we stopped rowing I could not help falling
asleep, although much against my will, for our
position was neither comfortable nor secure;
and thus I dozed and woke half a dozen times
before landing. On reaching the shore we found
difficulty in sleeping on account of the swarms of
hungry mosquitoes, so we soon loaded up again.</p>

<p>We had got caribou meat from some people
whom we passed half-way down Lake Labarge;
and the next day we saw a moose on an island,
but the current swept us by before we could get
a shot at him. Large game, on the whole, however,
was very scarce along this route. The
weather was warm and pleasant after leaving
Lake Labarge, and there were no serious obstructions.
The swift current bombarded the bottom
of the boat with grains of sand, making a sound
like a continual frying. "Look out!" Pete
would say. "The devil is frying his fat for us!"
We travelled easily sixty or eighty miles a day,
floating with the current and rowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Danlon's party, which we had lost sight of on
Lake Labarge, reached us a couple of days afterwards,
having pulled night and day to catch
up. They were grey and speckled with fatigue
and told us of having decided to leave one
boat (they came with only one of the two they
had started in) at Lake Labarge, and also of
leaving some of their provisions. They had unfortunately
forgotten to keep any sugar&mdash;could
we lend them some? We produced the sugar
and smiled knowingly; a few days later we ran
across the solitary Dutchman, who had engineered
his wood-box thus far, and he told us
the whole story: how when the boats got near
the shore one was swamped in shallow water,
losing most of its cargo, and how the occupants
had to stand in cold water the rest of the night,
finally getting to shore and to rights again. The
priest had been naming the camps after the letters
of the Greek alphabet, and the night on
Labarge should have been Camp Rho; and this
was appropriate as we rowed nearly all night.</p>

<p>From here the journey was comparatively
easy. The skies were always clear and blue, and
the stream had by this time increased to a lordly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
river, growing larger by continual accessions of
new tributaries. It is dotted with many small
islands, which are covered with a dense growth
of evergreen trees. On the side of the valley
are often long smooth terraces, perfectly carved
and smoothly grassed, so as to present an almost
artificial aspect. From this sort of a country are
sudden changes to a more bold and picturesque
type, so at one time the river flows swiftly
through high gates of purple rock rising steeply
for hundreds of feet, and in a few moments
more emerges into a wide low valley. The
cliffs are sometimes carved into buttresses or
pinnacles, which overlook the walls, and appear
to form part of a gigantic and impregnable
castle, on the top of which the dead spruces
stand out against the sky like spires and flag-staves.
Usually on one side or the other of the
river is low fertile land, where grows a profusion
of shrubs and flowers.</p>

<p>In the mellow twilight, which lasts for two or
three hours in the middle of the night, one can
see nearly as far and as distinctly as by day, but
everything takes on an unreal air. This is something
like a beautiful sunset effect further south,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
but is evenly distributed over all the landscape.
At about ten o'clock the coloring becomes exquisite,
when the half-light brings out the violets,
the purples, and various shades of yellow
and brown in the rocks, in contrast to the green
of the vegetation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i100.jpg" width="600" height="490" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Talking it Over.</span></div>
</div>

<p>We had some difficulty in finding suitable
camping-places in this country. One night I remember,
we ran fifteen miles after our usual
camping-hour, with cliffs on one side of the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and low thickets on the other. Three times we
landed on small islands, in a tangle of vines and
roses; and as many times we were driven off by
the innumerable mosquitoes. At last we found
a strip of shore about ten feet wide, between the
water and the thickets, sloping at a considerable
angle; and there we made shift to spend the
night.</p>

<p>There are two places below the White Horse
Rapids where the channel is so narrowed or
shallowed that rapids are formed. At the first
of these, called the "Five Finger Rapids," the
river is partially blocked by high islets, which
cut up the stream in several portions. Although
the currents in each of these "fingers" is rapid,
and the water rough, yet we found no difficulty
in running through without removing any part
of the load, although one of the boats shipped a
little water. When we arrived at the second
place, which is called the "Rink Rapids," and is
not far below the Five Fingers, we were relieved
to find that owing to the fullness of the
river, the rough water, which in this case is
caused by the shallowing of the stream, was
smoothed down, and we went through, close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the shore, with no more trouble than if we had
been floating down a lake.</p>

<p>During the whole trip the country through
which we passed was singularly lonely and uninhabited.
After leaving the few huts on Tagish
Lake, which I have mentioned, we saw a few Indians
in a summer camp on Lake Labarge; and
this was all until we got to the junction of the
Lewes and Pelly Rivers, over three hundred miles
from Tagish Lake. At Pelly we found a log
trading-post, with a single white man in charge,
and a few Indians. There were also three miners,
who had met with misfortune, and were disconsolate
enough. They had started up Pelly River
with a two years' outfit, intending to remain and
prospect for that period, but at some rapid water
their boat had been swamped and all their provisions
lost. They had managed to burn off logs
enough to build a raft, and in that way had
floated down the river to the post, living in the
meantime on some flour which they had been
lucky enough to pick up after the wreck.</p>

<p>Although there are very few people in the
country, one is continually surprised at first by
perceiving solitary white tents standing on some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
prominent point or cliff which overlooks the river.
At first this looks very cheerful, and we sent
many a hearty hail across the river to such places;
but our calls were never answered, for these are
not the habitations of the living but of the dead.
Inside of each of these tents, which are ordinarily
made of white cloth, though sometimes of woven
matting, is a dead Indian, and near him is laid
his rifle, snowshoes, ornaments and other personal
effects. I do not think the custom of leaving
these articles at the grave implies any belief
that they will be used by the dead man in another
world, but simply signifies that he will have no
more use for the things which were so dear to
him in life&mdash;just as among ourselves, articles
which have been used by dear friends are henceforth
laid aside and no longer used. These dwellings
of the dead are always put in prominent positions,
commanding as broad and fair a view as
can be obtained. At Pelly we saw several Indian
graves that were surrounded by hewn palings,
rudely and fantastically painted.</p>

<p>When we reached the White River we found
it nearly as broad as the Yukon. The waters of
the two rivers are separated by a distinct line at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
their confluence and for some distance further
down, the Yukon water being dark and the other
milky, whence the name&mdash;White River. All over
this country is a thin deposit of white dust-like
volcanic ash, covering the surface, but on White
River this ash is very thick, and the river flowing
through it carries away enough to give the
waters continually a milky appearance. As we
approached White River we beheld what seemed
a most extraordinary cloud hanging over its valley.
It was a solid compact mass of white, like
some great ice-flower rising from the hills, reminding
one as one explored it through field-glasses,
in its snowy vastness and unevenness, of
some great glacier. The clouds were in rounded
bunches and each bunch was crenulated. Below
was a mass of smoke with a ruddy reflection as
if from some great fire, and smaller snowy compact
clouds came up at intervals, as if gulped out
from some crater. This we thought might be the
fabled volcano of the White River, but on getting
nearer it seemed to be probably a forest-fire.
Although there are no railway trains to set fires
with their sparks, nowhere do fires start more
easily than in Alaska, for the ground is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
covered deep with a peat-like dry moss, which ignites
when one lights a fire above and smoulders
so persistently that it can hardly be extinguished,
creeping along under the roots of the living moss
and breaking out into flame on opportunity.</p>

<p>The Fourth of July was celebrated by shooting
at a mark; and that night we had a true blessing,
for we camped on a little bare sandspit on an
island, where the wind was brisk and kept the
mosquitoes away. These insects cannot stand
against a breeze, but are whisked away by it like
the imps of darkness at the first breath of God's
morning light, as we have read in fairy stories.
The freedom was delicious, so we just stretched
ourselves in the sand, and slept ten hours. We
were awakened by a violent plunge in the water
and stuck our heads out of the blankets in a
hurry, thinking it was a moose; but it turned
out to be only one of our party celebrating the
day after the Fourth by a bath.</p>

<p>At Sixty Mile we found an Indian trading-post,
located on an island in the river, and kept by
Jo La Du, a lonely trader who a year afterwards
became rich and famous from his participation in
the Klondike rush. He had no idea of this when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
we saw him, but shook hands with us shyly and
silently, a man whom years had made more accustomed
to the Indian than to the white man.</p>

<p>The name Sixty Mile is applied to a small river
here, which is sixty miles from old Fort Reliance,
an ancient trading post belonging to the
Hudson Bay Company. The hardy and intrepid
agents of the company were the first white men
to explore the interior of Alaska. The lower
Yukon in the vicinity of the delta was explored
by the Russians in 1835 to 1838, and the river was
called by the Eskimo name of Kwikpuk or
Kwikpak,&mdash;the great river: in 1842-3 the Russian
Lieutenant Zagoskin explored as far as the
Nowikakat. But the upper Yukon was first explored
by members of the Hudson Bay Company.
In 1846 a trader named Bell crossed from the
Mackenzie to the Porcupine, and so down to the
Yukon, to which he first applied the name by
which it is now known: it is an Indian, not
Eskimo, word. Previous to this, in 1840, Robert
Campbell, of the Hudson Bay Company,
crossed from the Stikeen to the Pelly and so down
to its junction with the Lewes or upper Yukon.
At the point of the junction Campbell built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Fort Selkirk, which was afterwards pillaged and
burned by the Indians, and remained deserted till
Harper built the present post, close to the site of
the old one. Forty miles below old Fort Reliance
is Forty Mile Creek, so that the mouths of Forty
Mile and Sixty Mile are a hundred miles apart.
The river by this time is a mile wide in places,
and filled with low wooded islands: its water is
muddy and the eddying currents give the appearance
of boiling.</p>

<p>We found no one on the site of old Fort Reliance,
and we used the fragments of the old buildings
lying around in the grass for fire-wood. It
was practically broad daylight all night, for although
the sun went down behind the hills for an
hour or two, yet it was never darker than a
cloudy day.</p>

<p>The day of leaving Fort Reliance we came to
the junction of the Klondike or Thronduc River
with the Yukon, and found here a village of
probably two hundred Indians, but no white
men. The Indians were living in log cabins: on
the shore numbers of narrow and shallow birch
canoes were drawn up, very graceful and delicate
in shape, and marvellously light, weighing only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
about thirty pounds, but very difficult for any
one but an Indian to man&oelig;uvre. Yet the natives
spear salmon from these boats. At the
time we were there most of the male Indians
were stationed along the river, eagerly watching
for the first salmon to leap out of the water, for
about this time of the year the immigration of
these fish begins, and they swim up the rivers
from the sea thousands of miles, to place their
spawn in some quiet creek. On account of the
large number of salmon who turn aside to enter
the stream here, the Indians called it Thronduc
or <i>fish-water</i>; this is now corrupted by the miners
into Klondike, the Indian village is replaced
by the frontier city of Dawson, and the fame of
the Klondike is throughout the world.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Alaska Humpbacked Salmon, Male and Female.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The trip of forty miles from Fort Reliance to
Forty Mile Post was made in the morning, and
was enlivened by an exciting race between our
boat and that belonging to Danlon. We had kept
pretty closely together on all our trip, passing
and repassing one another, but our boat was generally
ahead; and when we both encamped at Fort
Reliance, the other party resolved to outwit us.
So they got up early in the morning and slipped
away before we were well awake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> When we discovered
that they were gone, we got off after them
as quickly as possible, but as the current flows
about seven miles an hour, and they were rowing
hard besides, they were long out of sight of
us. However, we buckled down to hard rowing,
each pulling a single oar only, and relieving one
another at intervals, tugging away as desperately
as if something important depended on it.
When we were already in sight of Forty Mile
Post we spied our opponents' boat about a mile
ahead of us, and we soon overhauled them, for
they had already spent themselves by hard rowing.
Then Pete knew a little channel which led
up to the very centre of the camp, while the others
took the more roundabout way, so that we
arrived and were quite settled&mdash;we assumed a
very negligent air, as if we had been there all
day&mdash;when the others arrived. We called this
the great Anglo-American boat race and crowed
not a little over the finish.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
THE FORTY MILE DIGGINGS.</h2>


<p>Forty Mile Creek is the oldest mining
camp in the Yukon country, and the first
where coarse gold or "gulch diggings" was found.
In the fall of 1886 a prospector by the name of
Franklin discovered the precious metal near the
mouth of what is now called Forty Mile Creek.
This stream was put down on the old maps as
the Shitando River, but miners are very independent
in their nomenclature, and often adopt a
new name if the old one does not suit them, preferring
a simple term with an evident meaning to
the more euphonious ones suggestive of Pullman
cars. At the time of the discovery of gold there
was a post of the Alaskan Commercial Company
at the mouth of the stream, but the trader in
charge, Jack McQuesten, was absent in San Francisco.
As the supplies at the post were very
low, and a rush of miners to the district was
anticipated for the next summer, it was thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
best to try to get word to the trader, and George
Williams undertook to carry out a letter in midwinter.</p>

<p>Accompanied by an Indian, he succeeded in
attaining the Chilkoot Pass, but was there
frozen to death. The letter, however, was carried
to the post at Dyea by the Indian, and
the necessary supplies were sent, thus averting
the threatened famine. From 1887 to 1893 the
various gulches of Forty Mile Creek were the
greatest gold producers of the Yukon country,
but by 1893 the supplies of gold began to show
exhaustion; and about this time a Russian half-breed,
by the name of Pitka, discovered gold in
the bars of Birch Creek, some two hundred miles
further down the Yukon.</p>

<p>A large part of the population of the Forty
Mile district rushed to the new diggings and
built the mining camp to which they gave the
name of Circle City, from its proximity to the
Arctic Circle. The Forty Mile district is partly
in British and partly in American territory, since
the boundary line crosses the stream some distance
above its mouth, while Birch Creek is entirely
in American territory. The world-renowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Klondike, again, is within British boundaries.
So the tide of mining population has
ebbed back and forth in the Yukon country,
each wave growing larger than the first, till it
culminated in the third of the great world-rushes
after gold, exciting, wild and romantic&mdash;the
Klondike boom, a fit successor to the "forty-nine"
days of California, and to the events which
followed the discovery of gold in Australia.</p>

<p>At the time of our visit, in 1896, Forty Mile
Post was distinctly on the decline. Yet it contained
probably 500 or 600 inhabitants, not
counting the Indians, of whom there were a
considerable number. These Indians were called
Charley Indians, from their chief Charley.
There is a mission near here and the Indians
have all been Christianized. It is told that the
Tanana Indians, who had no mission, and who
came here out of their wild fastnesses only once
in a while to trade, did not embrace Christianity,
which rather elated Charley's followers, as they
considered that they now had decidedly the advantage;
and they openly vaunted of it. In
this country at certain times of the year, particularly
in the fall, great herds of caribou pass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and then one can slaughter as many as he needs
for the winter's supply of meat, without much
hunting, for the animals select some trail and
are not easily scared from it. One fall a herd
marched up one of the busiest mining gulches of
Birch Creek and the miners stood in their cabin
doors and shot them.</p>

<p>So the Indians always watch as eagerly for
the caribou, as they do for the salmon in the
summer. But this particular fall it happened
that the animals stayed away from the Charley
Indians' hunting grounds, but passed through
those of the Tananas in force. The heathen
then came down to the trading post laden with
meat, and the chief, who knew a little English,
taunted Charley in it.</p>

<p>"Where moose, Charley?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No moose," said Charley.</p>

<p>"Woo!" said the Tanana chief, grinning in
triumph. "What's the matter with your Jesus?"</p>

<p>The Indians at Forty Mile Post were mostly
encamped in tents or were living in rude huts of
timber plastered with mud; while the white
men had built houses of logs, unsquared, with
the chinks filled with mud and moss and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
roof covered with similar material. Prices were
high throughout: A lot of land in the middle
of the town, say 100 by 150 feet, was worth
$7,000 or $8,000; sugar was worth twenty-five
cents a pound and ordinary labor ten dollars a
day. All provisions were also very expensive,
and the supply was often short. Many common
articles, usually reckoned among what the foolish
call the necessities of life, could not be obtained
by us. I say foolish, because one can
learn from pioneering and exploring, upon how
little life can be supported and health and
strength maintained, and how many of the supposed
necessities are really luxuries.</p>

<p>The Alaskan Eskimo lives practically on fish
alone throughout the year, without salt, without
bread,&mdash;just fish&mdash;and grows fat and oily and of
pungent odor. But white men can hardly become
so simple in their diet without some danger
of dying in the course of the experiment,
like the famous cow that was trained to go without
eating, but whose untimely death cut short
her career in the first bloom of success.</p>

<p>The miners have always been dependent for
supplies on steamers from San Francisco or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Seattle, which have to make a trip of 4,000 miles
or more; and, in the early days, if any accident
occurred, there was no other source.</p>

<p>I have heard of a bishop of the Episcopal
Church, a missionary in this country, who lived
all winter upon moose meat, without salt; and
an old miner told me of working all summer on
flour alone. When the fall came he shot some
caribou, and his description of his sensations on
eating his first venison steak were touching.
Hardly a winter has passed until very recently
when the miners were not put on rations&mdash;so
many pounds of bacon and so much flour to the
man,&mdash;to bridge over the time until the steamer
should arrive. The winter of 1889-90 is known
to the old Yukon pioneer as the "starvation
winter," for during the previous summer a succession
of accidents prevented the river boat
from reaching Forty Mile with provisions. The
men were finally starved out and in October they
all began attempting to make their way down
the Yukon, towards St. Michaels, over a thousand
miles away, where food was known to be stored,
having been landed at this depot from ocean
steamers. Nearly a hundred men left the post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in small boats. Some travelled the whole distance
to St. Michaels, others stopped and
wintered by the way at the various miserable
trading posts, or in the winter camps of the Indians
themselves, wherever food could be found.
It happened that this year the river did not
freeze up so early as usual, which favored the
flight, though the journey down the lower part
of the river was made in running ice.</p>

<p>In connection with the shortness of provisions
and supplies in these early years, a story is told
of a worthless vagabond who used to hang
around Forty Mile Post, and whose hoaxes, invented
to make money, put the wooden nutmeg
and the oak ham of Connecticut to shame.
There was a dearth of candles one year at the
post, and in midwinter, when, for a while, the
sun hardly rises at all, that was no trifling privation.
The weather was cold, as it always is at
Forty Mile in the winter time. The trickster
had some candle molds in his possession, but no
grease; so he put the wicks into the molds,
which he filled with water colored white with
chalk or condensed milk. The water immediately
froze solid, making a very close imitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of a candle. He manufactured a large number
and then started around the post to peddle them.
All bought eagerly&mdash;Indian squaws to sew by,
miners, shop-keepers, everybody. One man
bought a whole case and shoved them under his
bed; when he came to pull them out again to
use, he found nothing but the wicks in a pile, the
ice having melted and the water having evaporated
in the warm room. What punishment was
meted out to this unique swindler I do not
know, but I could not learn that he was ever
severely dealt with.</p>

<p>The evening of our arrival in Forty Mile Post
we were attracted by observing a row of miners,
who were lined up in front of the saloon engaged
in watching the door of a large log cabin
opposite, rather dilapidated, with the windows
broken in. On being questioned, they said there
was going to be a dance, but when or how they
did not seem to know: all seemed to take only
a languid looker-on interest, speaking of the
affair lightly and flippantly. Presently more
men, however, joined the group and eyed the
cabin expectantly. In spite of their disclaimers
they evidently expected to take part, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
where were the fair partners for the mazy
waltz?</p>

<p>The evening wore on until ten o'clock, when
in the dusk a stolid Indian woman, with a baby
in the blanket on her back, came cautiously
around the corner, and with the peculiar long
slouchy step of her kind, made for the cabin
door, looking neither to the right nor to the left.
She had no fan, nor yet an opera cloak; she was
not even décolleté; she wore large moccasins
on her feet&mdash;number twelve, I think, according
to the white man's system of measurement&mdash;and
she had a bright colored handkerchief on her
head. She was followed by a dozen others, one
far behind the other, each silent and unconcerned,
and each with a baby upon her back.
They sidled into the log cabin and sat down on
the benches, where they also deposited their
babies in a row: the little red people lay there
very still, with wide eyes shut or staring, but
never crying&mdash;Indian babies know that is all
foolishness and doesn't do any good. The mothers
sat awhile looking at the ground in some one
spot and then slowly lifted their heads to look at
the miners who had slouched into the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
after them&mdash;men fresh from the diggings, spoiling
for excitement of any kind. Then a man
with a dilapidated fiddle struck up a swinging,
sawing melody, and in the intoxication of the
moment some of the most reckless of the miners
grabbed an Indian woman and began furiously
swinging her around in a sort of waltz, while the
others crowded around and looked on.</p>

<p>Little by little the dusk grew deeper, but
candles were scarce and could not be afforded.
The figures of the dancing couples grew more
and more indistinct and their faces became lost
to view, while the sawing of the fiddle grew
more and more rapid, and the dancing more excited.
There was no noise, however; scarcely a
sound save the fiddle and the shuffling of the
feet over the floor of rough hewn logs; for the
Indian women were stolid as ever, and the miners
could not speak the language of their partners.
Even the lookers-on said nothing, so that
these silent dancing figures in the dusk made an
almost weird effect.</p>

<p>One by one, however, the women dropped out,
tired, picked up their babies and slouched off
home, and the men slipped over to the saloon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
have a drink before going to their cabins.
Surely this squaw-dance, as they call it, was one
of the most peculiar balls ever seen. No sound
of revelry by night, no lights, no flowers, no introductions,
no conversations. Of all the Muses,
Terpsichore the nimble-footed, alone was represented,
for surely the nymph who presides over
music would have disowned the fiddle.</p>

<p>All the diggings in the Forty Mile district
were remote from the Post, and to reach them
one had to ascend Forty Mile Creek, a rapid
stream, for some distance. Pete left us here,
and we three concluded to go it alone. Inasmuch
as we were young and tender, we were
overwhelmed with advice of such various and
contradictory kinds that we were almost disheartened.
Every one agreed that it would be
impossible to take our boats up the river, that
we should take an "up river" boat, (that is, a
boat built long and narrow, with a wide overhang,
so as to make as little friction with the
water as possible, and to make upsetting difficult);
but when we came to inquire we found
there was no such boat to be had. We were advised
to take half-a-dozen experienced polers, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
such polers could not be found. Evidently we
must either wait the larger part of the summer
for our preparations <i>à la mode</i>, or go anyhow;
and this latter we decided to do. We announced
our intention at the table of the man whose
hospitality we were enjoying. He stared.</p>

<p>"You'll find Forty Mile Creek a hard river to
go up," he said, slowly. "Have you had much
experience in ascending rivers?"</p>

<p>"Very little," we replied.</p>

<p>"Are you good polers?" asked another.</p>

<p>"Like the young lady who was asked whether
she could play the piano," I answered, "we don't
know&mdash;we never tried." Everybody roared;
they had been wanting to laugh for some time,
and here was their opportunity. Later a guide
was offered to us, but we had got on our dignity
and refused him; then he asked to be allowed to
accompany us as a passenger, taking his own
food, and helping with the boat, and we consented
to this. He had a claim on the headwaters
of Sixty Mile, to which he wished to go
back, but could not make the journey up the
river alone. A year afterwards this penniless
fellow was one of the lucky men in the Klondike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
rush and came back to civilization with a reputed
fortune of $100,000.</p>

<p>We could row only a short distance up the
creek from the post, for after this the current
became so swift that we could make no headway.
We then tied a long line to the bow of
the boat, and two of us, walking on the shore,
pulled the line, while another stood in the bow
and by constant shoving out into the stream,
succeeded in overcoming the tendency for the
pull of the line to make the boat run into the
shore or into such shallow water that it would
ground. We soon reached the canyon, supposed
to be the most difficult place in the creek to
pass; here the stream is very rapid and tumbles
foaming over huge boulders which have partially
choked it. We towed our boat up through this,
however, without much difficulty, and on the
second night camped at the boundary line.</p>

<p>Here a gaunt old character, Sam Patch by
name, had his cabin. He was famous for his
patriotism and his vegetables. His garden was
on the steep side of a south-facing hill and was
sheltered from the continual frosts which fall in
the summer nights, so that it succeeded well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Foreign vegetables, as well as native plants,
thrive luxuriantly in Alaska so long as they can
be kept from being frost-bitten: for in the long
sunshiny summer days they grow twice as fast
and big as they do in more temperate climates.
"Sam Patch's potato patch" was famous throughout
the diggings, and the surest way to win
Sam's heart was to go and inspect and admire it.
Sam was always an enthusiastic American, and
when the Canadian surveyors surveyed the
meridian line which constituted the International
boundary, they ran it right through his potato
patch; but he stood by his American flag and
refused to haul it down&mdash;quite unnecessarily,
because no one asked him to do so.</p>

<p>The next day we reached the mouth of the
little tributary called Moose Creek. From here
a trail thirty miles in length leads over the low
mountains to the headwaters of Sixty Mile
Creek, where several of the richest gulches of
the Forty Mile district were located. We
beached our boat, therefore, put packs on our
backs and started. At this time the days were
hot and the mosquitoes vicious, and nearly every
night was frosty; so we sweat and smarted all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
day, and shivered by night, for our blankets
were hardly thick enough. We used to remark
on rising in the morning that Alaska was a delightful
country, with temperature to suit every
taste; no matter if one liked hot weather or
moderate or cold, if he would wait he would get
it inside of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>We were tired when we started over the trail,
and the journey was not an easy one, for we
carried blankets, food, cameras, and other small
necessaries. We camped in a small swamp the
first night, where the ground was so wet that we
were obliged to curl up on the roots of trees,
close to the trunks, to keep out of the water.
The second day a forest fire blocked our journey,
but we made our way through it, treading swiftly
over the burning ground and through the thick
smoke: then we emerged onto a bare rocky ridge,
from which we could look down, on the right, over
the network of little valleys which feed Forty
Mile Creek, and on the other side over the tributaries
of Sixty Mile Creek, clearly defined as if
on a map. The ridge on which we travelled was
cut up like the teeth of a saw, so that a large part
of our time was spent in climbing up and down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>On the latter part of the second day we found
no wood, and at night we could hardly prepare
food enough to keep our stomachs from sickening.
My feet had become raw at the start from
hard boots, and every step was a torture; yet the
boots could not be taken off, for the trail was
covered with small sharp stones, and the packs on
our backs pressed heavily downward. The third
day we separated, each descending from the
mountain ridge into one of the little gulches, in
which we could see the white tents or the brown
cabins of the miners, with smoke rising here and
there. My way led me down a rocky ridge and
then abruptly into the valley of Miller Creek.
As I sat down and rested, surveying the little
valley well dotted with shanties, two men came
climbing up the trail and sat down to chat. They
were going to the spot on Forty Mile Creek
which we had just left&mdash;there was a keg of whisky
"cached" there and they had been selected a committee
of two by the miners to escort the aforesaid
booze into camp. They were alternately
doleful at the prospect of the sixty mile tramp and
jubilant over the promised whisky, for, as they informed
us, the camp had been "dry for some time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Descending into the camp where the men were
busily working, I stopped to watch them. Gaunt,
muscular, sweating, they stood in their long boots
in the wet gravel and shovelled it above their
heads into "sluice boxes,"&mdash;a series of long
wooden troughs in which a continuous current
of water was running. The small material was
carried out of the lower end of the sluices by the
water. Here and there the big stones choked
the current and a man with a long shovel was
continuously occupied with cleaning the boxes of
such accumulations. Everybody was working
intensely. The season is short in Alaska and the
claim-owner is generally a hustler; and men who
are paid ten dollars a day for shovelling must
jump to earn their money.</p>

<p>Strangers were rare on Miller Creek in those
days, and everybody stopped a minute to look and
answer my greetings politely, but there was no
staring, and everybody went on with his work
without asking any questions. Men are courteous
in rough countries, where each one must travel
on his merits and fight his own battles, and where
social standing or previous condition of servitude
count for nothing. I wandered slowly down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
from claim to claim. They were all working,
one below the other, for this was the best part
of one of the oldest and richest gulches of the
Forty Mile district. One man asked me where
I was going to sleep, and on my telling him
that I had not thought of it, replied that there
were some empty log cabins a little distance
below. Further down a tall, dark, mournful
man addressed me in broken English, with a
Canadian French accent, and put the same question.</p>

<p>"I work on ze night shift to-night," he continued,
"so I do not sleep in my bed. You like, you
no fin' better, you is very welcome, sair, to sleep
in my cabine, in my bed."</p>

<p>I accepted gratefully, for I was very tired; so
the Frenchman conducted me to a cabin about
six feet square and insisted upon cooking a little
supper for me. He was working for day's wages,
he answered to my rather blunt questions, but
hoped that he would earn enough this summer
and the next winter to buy an outfit and enough
"grub" to go prospecting for himself, on the
Tanana, which had not been explored and where
he believed there must be gold; prospectors get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
very firmly convinced of such things with no real
reason.</p>

<p>After supper he darkened the windows for me
and went to work. I sought the comfort of a
wooden bunk, covering myself with a dirty bed-quilt.
It was very ancient and perhaps did not
smell sweet, but what did I care? It was
Heaven. The darkness was delicious. I had not
known real darkness for so long throughout the
summer&mdash;always sleeping out of doors in the light
of the Alaskan night&mdash;that I had felt continually
strained and uncomfortable for the lack of it, and
this darkened cabin came to me like the sweetest
of opiates.</p>

<p>When I awoke the Frenchman was preparing
breakfast. I had slept some ten hours without
moving. There was only one tin plate, one cup,
and one knife and fork, and he insisted upon my
eating with them, while he stood by and gravely
superintended, urging more slapjacks upon me.
I suddenly felt ashamed that I had told him
neither my name nor business, for although I had
questioned him freely, he had not manifested the
slightest curiosity. So without being asked I
volunteered some information about myself. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
listened attentively and politely, but without any
great interest. It was quite apparent that the
most important thing to him was that I was a
stranger. Soon after breakfast I thanked him
warmly and went away&mdash;I knew enough of
miners not to insult him by offering him money
for his hospitality.</p>

<p>The night shift of shovellers had given way to
the day shift, and work was going on as fiercely
as ever. The bottoms of all these gulches are
covered with roughly stratified shingle, most of
which slides down from the steep hillsides of the
creek. Among the rocks on the hillsides are
many quartz veins, which carry "iron pyrite" or
"fool's gold"; these often contain small specks
of real gold. So when all the rubble gets together
and is broken up in the bottom of the
stream, where the water flows through it, the
different materials in the rocks begin to separate
one from another, more or less, according to the
difference in their weights and the fineness of
the fragments into which they are broken. Now
gold is the heaviest of metals, and the result is,
that through all this jostling and crowding it
gradually works itself down to the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
heap, and generally quite to the solid rock below.
This has been found to be the case nearly everywhere.
In process of time the gravel accumulations
become quite thick; in Miller Creek, for
example, they varied from three or four feet at
the head of the valley, where I was, to fifty or
sixty at the mouth. But all the upper gravels
are barren and valueless. Where the gravels are
not deep, they are simply shovelled off and out of
the way, till the lower part, where the gold lies,
is laid bare; this work generally takes a year,
during which time there is no return for the
labor.</p>

<p>Once the pay gravel&mdash;as it is called&mdash;is
reached, a long wooden trough called a "sluice,"
is constructed, the current turned through it, and
the gravel shovelled in. This work can only be
carried on in the summer-time, when the water
is not frozen, so that the warm months are the
time for hustling, day and night shifts being employed,
with as many men on each as can work
conveniently together. In case the barren overlying
gravel is very deep, the miners wait until
it is frozen and then sink shafts to the pay dirt,
which they take out by running tunnels and excavating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
chambers or "stopes" along the bed
rock. In this work they do not use blasting, but
build a small fire wherever they wish to penetrate,
and as soon as the gravel thaws they
shovel it up and convey it out, meanwhile pushing
the fire ahead so that more may thaw out. In
this way they accumulate the pay dirt in a heap
on the surface, and as soon as warm weather
comes they shovel it into the sluices as before.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit, the construction of
the sluices was a work of considerable labor, for
as there was no sawmill in the country, the
boards from which they were made had to be
sawed by hand out of felled trees.</p>

<p>In the last few of the trough-sections or sluice-boxes,
slats are placed, sometimes transverse,
sometimes lengthwise, sometimes oblique, sometimes
crossed, forming a grating&mdash;all patterns
have nearly the same effect, namely, to catch the
gold and the other heavy minerals by means
of vortexes which are created. Thus behind
these slats or "riffles" the gold lodges, while
the lighter and barren gravel is swept by the
current of water out of the trough, and the
heavy stones are thrust out by the shovel of the
miner. Nearly the same process as that which
in nature concentrates gold at the bottom of the
gravels and on top of the bed-rock is adopted by
man to cleanse the gold perfectly from the attendant
valueless minerals.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody was hospitable along the gulch. I
had five different invitations to dinner,&mdash;hearty
ones, too&mdash;and some were loath to be put off
with the plea of previous engagement. They
were all eager for news from the outside world,
from which they had not heard since the fall before;
keenly interested in political developments,
at home and abroad. They were intelligent and
better informed than the ordinary man, for in
the long winter months there is little to do but
to sleep and read. They develop also a surprising
taste for solid literature; nearly everywhere
Shakespeare seemed to be the favorite author, all
nationalities and degrees of education uniting in
the general liking. A gulch that had a full set
of Shakespeare considered itself in for a rather
cozy winter; and there were regular Shakespeare
clubs, where each miner took a certain
character to read. Books of science, and especially
philosophy, were also widely sought. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
has been my theory that in conditions like this,
where there are not the thousand and one stimuli
to fritter away the intellectual energy, the mental
qualities become stronger and keener and the
little that is done is done with surprising vigor
and clearness.</p>

<p>Down the creek I found a Swede, working
over the gravels on a claim that had already
been washed once. He had turned off the water
from the sluice-boxes and was scraping up the
residue from among the riffles. Mostly black
heavy magnetic iron particles with many sparkling
yellow grains of gold, green hornblendes
and ruby-colored garnets. He put all this into a
gold pan, (a large shallow steel pan such as used
in the first stages of prospecting), and proceeded
to "pan out" the gold yet a little more. He
immersed the vessel just below the surface of a
pool of water, and by skillful twirlings caused the
contents to be agitated, and while the heavier
particles sank quickly to the bottom, he continuously
worked off the lighter ones, allowing
them to flow out over the edge of the pan. Yet
he was very careful that no bit of gold should
escape, and when he had carried this process as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
far as he could, he invited me into his cabin to
see him continue the separation.</p>

<p>Here he spread the "dust" on the table and
began blowing it with a small hand-bellows.
The garnets, the hornblendes and the fragments
of quartz, being lighter than the rest, soon rolled
out to one side, leaving only the gold and the
magnetic iron. Then with a hand magnet he
drew the iron out from the gold, leaving the
noble yellow metal nearly pure, in flakes and
irregular grains. As the material he had separated
still contained some gold, he put this
aside to be treated with quicksilver. The quicksilver
is poured into the dust, where it forms an
amalgam with the gold: it is then strained off,
and the amalgam is distilled&mdash;the quicksilver is
vaporized, leaving the gold behind.</p>

<p>This man had his wife with him, a tired,
lonely looking woman. I asked her if there
were no more women on the creek. She said
no; there was another woman over on Glacier
Creek, and she wanted so much to see her sometimes,
but she was not a good woman, so she
could not go. She was lonely, she said; she had
been here three years and had not seen a woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>From some of the miners I obtained a pair
of Indian moccasins, which I padded well with
hay and cloth to make them easy for my chafing
feet; then I slung my own heavy boots on top
of my pack and the next morning bade the gulch
good-bye, feeling strengthened from my rest.
As I climbed out of the gulch I met the miners
who had gone as a committee to escort the
whisky, arriving with it, white and speckled
with fatigue, speaking huskily, (but not from
drinking), yet triumphant. The day was cool
and when one is alone one is apt to travel hard;
but the unwonted lightness of my feet and the
freedom from pain encouraged me, so I set my
Indian moccasins into a regular Indian trot, and
by noon had covered the entire fifteen miles that
constituted the first half of the journey. This
brought me to a locality dignified by the name
of the "Half-Way House," from a tent-fly of
striped drilling left by some one, in which the
miners were accustomed to pass the night in
their journeys over the trail. Here I found
Schrader, who had arrived late the night before
and was preparing to make a start. We lighted
a fire and made some tea, which with corned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
beef and crackers, made up our lunch. While
we were eating, our old companion Pete, with
two more miners, came in from the opposite
direction to that from which we had come;
he was on his way to visit his old claim on
Miller Creek. Afterwards we got away, and
kept up a steady Indian trot till we reached
our camp on Forty Mile Creek at about six
o'clock.</p>

<p>We found Goodrich already arrived and
wrestling with the cooking, with which he was
having tremendously hard luck. This travelling
thirty miles in one day, carrying an average of
thirty-five pounds, I considered something of an
achievement; but the tiredness which came the
next day showed that the energy meant for a
long time had been drawn upon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i139.jpg" width="600" height="478" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">"Tracking" a Boat Upstream.</span></div>
</div>

<p>For four days after that we worked our way
up Forty Mile Creek, making on an average
seven or eight miles a day. Mosquitoes were
abundant, and the weather showery. We used
the same method of pulling and poling as before,&mdash;a
laborious process and one calculated to ruin
the most angelic disposition. The river was
very low and consequently full of rapids and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
"riffles," as the miners call the shallow places
over which the water splashes. On many of
these riffles our boat stuck fast, and we dragged
it over the rocks by sheer force, wading out and
grasping it by the gunwale. Again, where there
were many large boulders piled together in deep
water, the boat would stick upon one, and we
would be obliged to wade out again and pilot it
through by hand, now standing dry upon a high
boulder, and now floundering waist deep in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
cold water at some awkward step&mdash;maybe losing
temper and scolding our innocent companions
for having shoved the boat too violently.</p>

<p>We generally worked till late, and began
cooking our supper in the dusk&mdash;which was now
beginning to come&mdash;over a camp-fire whose glare
dazzled us so that when we tossed our flapjack
into the air, preparatory to browning its raw
upper side, we often lost sight of it in the gloom,
and it sprawled upon the fire, or fell ignominiously
over the edge of the frying-pan. Those
were awful moments; no one dared to laugh at
the cook then. We took turns at cooking, and
patience was the watchword. The cook needed
it and much more so, those on whom he practiced.
One of our number produced a series of
slapjacks once which rivalled my famous Chilkoot
biscuit. They were leaden, flabby, wretched.
We ate one apiece, and ate nothing else for a
week, for, as the woodsmen say, it "stuck to our
ribs" wonderfully.</p>

<p>"How much baking powder did you put in
with the flour?" we asked the cook.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" he answered, indignantly.
"What was right, of course."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you measure it?" We persisted, for
the slapjack was irritating us inside.</p>

<p>"Anybody," replied the cook, with crushing
dignity, "who knows anything, knows how much
baking powder to put in with flour without
measuring it. I just used common sense." So
we concluded that he had put in too much common
sense and not enough baking powder.</p>

<p>Just above where the river divides into two
nearly equal forks, the water grew so shallow
that we could not drag our boat further, so we
hauled it up and filled it with green boughs
to prevent it from drying and cracking in the
sun; then we built a "cache."</p>

<p>It may be best to explain the word "cache,"
so freely used in Alaska. The term came from
the French Canadian voyageurs or trappers; it
is pronounced "cash" and comes from the
French <i>cacher</i>, to hide. So a cache is something
hidden, and was applied by these woodsmen to
hidden supplies and other articles of value, which
could not be carried about, being secreted until
the owners should come that way again. In
Alaska, when anything was thus left, a high
platform of poles was built, supported by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
trunks of slender trees, and the goods were left on
this platform, covered in some way against the
ravages of wild animals. To this structure the
name "cache" came to be applied; and later
was extended to the storehouses wherein the
natives kept their winter supplies of fish and
smoked meat, for these houses have a somewhat
similar structure, being built on top of upright
poles like the old Swiss lake-dwellings.</p>

</div>

<p>The next morning we shouldered our pack-sacks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
containing our blankets, a little food, and
other necessities, and were again on the tramp,
this time having no trail, however, but being
obliged to keep on the side of the stream. Here,
as below, the river flowed in one nearly continuous
canyon, but on one side or the other flats
had been built out on the side where the current
was slackest, while on the opposite side was
deep water quite up to the bold cliffs; and since
the current sweeps from side to side, one encounters
levels and gravel flats, and high rocks, on
the same side. Many of the cliffs we scaled,
crawling gingerly along the almost perpendicular
side of the rock. The constant temptation in
such climbing is to go higher, where it always
looks easier, but when one gets up it seems impossible
to return. However, we had no accidents,
which, considering how awkward our
packs made us, was lucky. At other times we
waded the stream to avoid the cliffs.</p>

<p>At night we reached the mouth of Franklin
Gulch, where active mining had been going on
for some time. The miners were almost out of
food, the boat which ordinarily brought provisions
from Forty Mile Post having been unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to get up, on account of the low water. Yet
they gave us freely what they could. We
took possession of an empty log cabin, lighted a
fire and toasted some trout which they gave us,
and this with crackers and bacon made our
meal; then we discovered some bunks with
straw in them, which we agreed were gilt-edged,
and proceeded to make use of them without delay.
Only a few of the total number of miners
were here, the rest having gone over the mountain
to Chicken Creek, where the latest find of
gold was reported. The men had not heard
from "the outside" for some time. Even Forty
Mile Post was a metropolis for them and they
were glad to hear from it. They had few
books and only a couple of newspapers three years
old.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it get very dull here?" we asked of
an old stager; "what do you do for amusement?"</p>

<p>"Do!" he echoed with grave humor, "Do!
why, God bless you, we 'ave very genteel amusements.
As for readin' an' litrachure an' all that,
wy, dammit, wen the fust grub comes in the
spring, we 'ave a meetin' an' we call all the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
together an' we app'int a chairman an' then some
one reads from the directions on the bakin'-powder
boxes."</p>

<p>I set out alone for Chicken Creek the next
morning, following a line of blazed trees up over
the mountain from Franklin Creek. I had been
told that once up on the divide one could look right
down into Chicken Creek, and I have no doubt
that this is true, for on attaining the top of the
hill a stretch of country twenty miles across was
spread out before me as on a map, while directly
below was a considerable branch of Forty Mile
Creek, divided into many closely adjacent
gulches. One of these must be Chicken Creek,
but which? There were no tents and no smoke
visible, much as the eye might strain through
the field-glasses. Just here the trail gave out, the
blazer having evidently grown tired of blazing.
Thinking to obtain a better view into the valley,
I set out along the hill which curved around it,
tramping patiently along until nearly night over
the sharp ridges, but without ever seeing any
signs of life in the great desolate country below
me. When the dark shadows were striking the
valleys, I caught sight of what appeared to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
faint smoke in the heart of a black timbered
gulch, and I made straightway down the mountain-side
for it, hurrying for fear the fire should
be extinguished before I could get close enough
to it to find the place. I had no doubt that this
came from the log cabin of some prospector, who
would be only too glad to welcome a weary
stranger with a warm supper and a blanket on
the floor.</p>

<p>On getting down, away from the bare rocks on
the mountain ridge, I found deep moss, tiresome
to my wearied limbs, and further down great
areas of "niggerheads"&mdash;the terror of travellers
in the northern swamps. These niggerheads
are tufts of vegetation which grow upwards by
successive accumulations till they are knee high
or even more. They are scattered thickly about,
but each tuft is separated completely from all the
rest, leaving hardly space to step between; if one
attempts to walk on top of them he will slip off,
so there is nothing to do but to walk on the
ground, lifting the legs over the obstacles with
great exertion. The tops of the tufts are covered
with long grass, which droops down on all sides,
whence the name niggerheads,&mdash;<i>têtes de femme</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
or women's heads is the name given them by the
French Canadian voyageurs.</p>

<p>Still lower the brush and vines became so thick
that it was almost impossible to force the way
through in places. At last I emerged upon a
grey lifeless area which seemed to have been
burned over. There were no trees or plants, but
the bare blackened sticks of what had once been
a young growth of spruce still stood upright,
though some trunks had fallen and lay piled, obstacles
to travelling. The whole looked peculiarly
forlorn. A little further I came to the spot
where I had seen the smoke. There was nothing
but a stagnant pool covered so deep with green
scum that one caught only an occasional glimpse
of the black water beneath, and from this, unsavory
mists were rising in the chill of the evening
air. I had mistaken these vapors for smoke from
my post miles up the mountain. My dream of a
log cabin and a blanket went up likewise in
smoke.</p>

<p>It was now eleven o'clock at night, and twilight;
I had walked at least twenty miles through
a rough country and could go no further. So I
broke off the smaller dried trees and sticks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
lighted a fire, then I ate some crackers and bacon
that I had with me, but I did not dare to drink
the water of the stagnant pool, which was all
there was to be had. The night grew frosty, and
I had no blankets; but I lay down close to the
fire and caught fifteen-minute naps. Once I
woke with the smell of burning cloth in my nostrils:
in my sleep I had edged too close to the
grateful warmth, and my coat and the notebook
in my pocket, containing all my season's notes,
had caught fire. I rolled over on them and crushed
out the fire with my fingers, and after that I
shivered away a little further from the fire. At
about three o'clock it grew light enough to see
the surrounding country, and I started out again
for the first point I had reached on the ridge the
morning before, thinking to get back to Franklin
Gulch, for I was thoroughly exhausted. On reaching
the ridge, however, I met a miner coming
over the trail; he agreed to pilot me to the new
prospects, so I turned back again.</p>

<p>There were fifteen or twenty men in the gulch
which we finally reached, all living in tents in a
very primitive way, and all very short of provisions,
yet, hospitable to the last morsel, they freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
offered the best they had. They were poor, too;
everybody does not get rich in the gold diggings,
even in Alaska. In fact, previous to the Klondike
discovery, the largest net sum of money
taken out by any one man was about $30,000,
while hundreds could not pay for their provisions
or get enough to buy a ticket out of the country.
The Klondike, too, has been badly lied about.
Not one man in twenty who goes there makes
more than a bare living, and many have to "hustle"
for that harder than they would at home.
So the hospitality of the miners, such as I found
it nearly everywhere on the Yukon, is not a mere
act of courtesy which costs nothing, but the genuine
unselfishness which cheerfully divides the
last crust with a passing stranger.</p>

<p>Having been strengthened by two square
meals, simple but sufficient, I started back for
Franklin Gulch the same night. It began to rain
in torrents on the way, and this, as usual, drove
out the mosquitoes and made them unusually savage.
They attacked me in such numbers that in
spite of my gloves and veil I was nearly frantic.
The best relief was to stride along at a good
round pace, for this kept most of the pests at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
back, and gave me a vent for my wrought-up
nerves; and at the same time I had the satisfaction
of knowing I was "getting there." The
thong of my moccasin became undone, but I did
not dare to stop to tie it, but kept plunging along,
shuffling it with me. I reached our cabin at the
mouth of Franklin Gulch, and the sight of the
bunk with straw in it, and the familiar grey
blanket, was sweet to me.</p>

<p>Next day we bade the miners at the creek's
mouth good-bye, with promises to hurry up the
provision-boat if possible, and made our way to
where we had left our boat and cache. The
next morning we launched the Skookum again,
and began our journey back. Going down was
quicker work than coming up, not so laborious,
and far more exciting. Owing to the lowness of
the water, the stream was one succession of small
rapids, which were full of boulders; and to steer
the boat, careering like a race horse, among
these, was a pretty piece of work. One pulled
the oars to give headway, another steered, and
the third stood in the bow, pole in hand,
to fend us off from such rocks as we were in
danger of striking. We soon found that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
safest part of such a rapid is where the waves
are roughest, for here the water, rebounding
from the shallow shore on either side, meets in a
narrow channel, where it tosses and foams, yet
here is the only place where there is no danger
of striking.</p>

<p>The second day out we ran twenty-five or
thirty of these rapids. In running through one
we pulled aside to avoid a large boulder sticking
up in midstream, and then saw in front of us
another boulder just at the surface, which we
had not before noticed. It was too late, however,
and the boat stuck fast in a second, and
began to turn over from the force of the water
behind. With one accord we all leaped out of
the boat, expecting to find foothold somewhere
among the boulders, and hold the boat or shove
her off so that she should not capsize; but none
of us touched bottom, though we sank to our
necks, still grasping the gunwale of the boat.
Our being out, however, made the boat so much
lighter that she immediately slipped over the
rock and went gloriously down the rapid, broadside,
we hanging on. As soon as we could we
clambered in, each grasped a paddle or oars or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
pole, and by great good luck we had no further
accident.</p>

<p>Some distance further down we again sighted
white water ahead, where the stream ran hard
against a perpendicular cliff. Some miners were
"rocking" gravel for gold in the bars just
above; and we yelled to them to know if we
could run the rapids.</p>

<p>"Yes," came the answer, "if you're a d&mdash;&mdash;d
good man!"</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;thanks!" we cried, and sailed
serenely through. This was known by the
cheerful name of Dead Man's Riffle. Owing to
the strong wind blowing, the mosquitoes were
not very annoying these few days; the sun was
warm and bright, and the hillsides were covered
thickly with a carmine flower which gave them
a general brilliant appearance. These things,
with the exhilaration of running rapids, made a
sort of vacation&mdash;an outing, a picnic, as it were&mdash;in
contrast to our previous hard work. When
we got to the Miller Creek trail we took on a
couple of miners who wanted to get out of the
country, but had no boat in which to go down
to Forty Mile Post. They had worked for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
time and had barely succeeded in making enough
to buy food, and now, a little homesick and discouraged,
they had made up their minds to try
to get out and back to "God's country" as they
called it&mdash;Colorado. With their help we let our
boat down through the "Cañon" safely, and
the next day,&mdash;the 29th of July,&mdash;arrived at
Forty Mile Post.</p>

<p>At the Post we found that plenty was reigning,
for the first steamboat had arrived, bringing
a lot of sorely-needed provisions. The trader in
charge gave us a fine lunch of eggs, moosemeat,
canned asparagus, and other delicacies, and then
we took possession of a deserted log cabin. On
ransacking around we found a Yukon lamp, consisting
of a twisted bit of cotton stuck into a
pint bottle of seal oil, and when it began to grow
dusk we lighted it and sat down at the table and
wrote home to our friends; for the steamer had
gone further up the river and would return in a
few days, so that letters sent down by her would
probably be ahead of us in getting home&mdash;eight
thousand miles! We had laid in a new stock of
provisions. Flour, I remember was $8.00 for
100 pounds, and we managed to get a few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the last eggs which the steamer had brought, at
$1.00 a dozen.</p>

<p>The Skookum had suffered considerably in our
Forty Mile trip, and we spent a large part of the
next day in patching her, plugging her seams
with oakum and sealing them with hot pitch.
One of our number, who was cooking for the
boat-menders, suddenly appeared on the scene,
chasing a pack of yelping dogs with our long
camp-axe. He had gone to the woodpile for a
moment, leaving the door ajar. At this moment
a grey dog whose tail had been cut off
somehow, was looking around the log house
opposite&mdash;he had been on guard and watching
our door for the last twenty-four hours. He
uttered a low yelp which brought a dozen others
together from all quarters, all lean, strong and
sneaking; and they slipped into our door.
When the cook turned from the woodpile a
minute later he was just in time to aim a billet
at the last one as he emerged from the cabin
with our cheese in his mouth. They fled swiftly
and were not to be caught: and an examination
showed that they had, in their silent and well
organized raid, cleaned our larder thoroughly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
having eaten the delicacies on the spot and
carried off nearly all the rest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i155.jpg" width="600" height="474" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Native Dogs.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The Indian dog is a study, for he is much unlike
his civilized brother. He rarely barks, never
at strangers, and takes no notice of a white man
who arrives in the village,&mdash;even though the village
may never have seen such a thing, and the
children scream, the women flee, and the men are
troubled and silent&mdash;but he howls nights. A dog
wakes up in the middle of the night, yawns, looks
at the stars, and listens. There is not a sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
"How dull and stupid it is here in Ouklavigamute,"
he thinks; "not nearly as lively as it was
in Mumtreghloghmembramute. There we had
fights nearly every night, sometimes twice. If I
only knew a dog I was sure I could lick&mdash;anyhow,
here goes for a good long howl. I'll show them
that there is a dog in town with spirit enough to
make a noise, anyhow." With that he tunes up&mdash;do,
re, mi, tra-la-la, dulce, crescendo, grand
Wagnerian smash. The other dogs wake up and
one nudges the other and says, "Oh, my, what a
lark! Isn't it fun! Let's yell too&mdash;whoop, roo,
riaow!" And just as men get excited at a football
game, or an election, or when the fire-alarm
rings, these dogs yell and grow red in the face.
Then the inhabitants wake up and get out after
the dogs, who run and yelp; and after a while
each cur crawls into a hiding-place and goes to
sleep. In the morning they wake up and wriggle
their tails. "What enthusiasm there was last
night&mdash;but&mdash;er&mdash;I didn't quite catch on to the
idea&mdash;of course I yelled to help the other fellows&mdash;it's
such fun being enthusiastic, you know."</p>

<p>This happens every night. The Indian dog
makes it a point to stand around like a bump on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
a log and look stupid; when he has fooled you to
that extent he will surprise you some day by a
daring theft, for he is clever as a man and quick
as an express train.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
THE AMERICAN CREEK DIGGINGS.</h2>


<p>From Forty Mile we floated down the Yukon
again, and in a day's journey camped at the
mouth of Mission Creek, not then down on the
map. It had received its name from miners who
had come there prospecting. Several of them
were encamped in tents, and they came over and
silently watched our cooking, evidently sizing us
up.</p>

<p>"When did you leave the Outside?" asked a
blue-eyed, blonde, shaggy man. (The Outside
means anywhere but Alaska&mdash;a man who has
been long in the country falls into the idea of
considering himself in a kind of a prison, and refers
to the rest of the world as lying beyond the
door of this.)</p>

<p>"In June," we replied.</p>

<p>"How did the Harvard-Yale football game
come out last fall?" he inquired eagerly&mdash;it was
now August, and nearly time for the next!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Harvard was whipped, of course," we answered.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, firing up, "you needn't
say 'of course.' Harvard is <i>my</i> college!"</p>

<p>I was engaged in reinforcing my overalls with
a piece of bacon sack; I could not help being
amused at this fair-haired savage being a college
man. "That makes no difference," I replied.
"Harvard's <i>our</i> college too&mdash;all of us."</p>

<p>"What are you giving me?" he ejaculated, and
at first I thought he looked a little angry, as if
he thought we were trifling with him; and then a
little supercilious, as he surveyed the forlorn condition
of my clothing, which the removal of the
overalls I wore instead of trousers had exposed.</p>

<p>"Hard facts," I said. "Classes of '92 and '93.
Lend me your sheath-knife."</p>

<p>"Why-ee!" he exclaimed. "Ninety-three's my
class. Shake!&mdash;Rah, rah, rah! Who are we?&mdash;You
know!&mdash;Who are we? We are Harvard
ninety-three&mdash;what can we do?&mdash;<span class="smcap">What can we
do?</span>&mdash;We can lick Harvard ninety-two&mdash;cocka-doodle-doodle-doo&mdash;Harvard,
Harvard&mdash;ninety-two&mdash;hooray!"</p>

<p>The next day we tramped over to American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Creek together, where some new gold diggings
were just being developed. The Harvard miner
had had no tea for several months, as he told us
(and one who has been living in Alaska knows what
a serious thing that is) so we brought a pound package
along to make a drink for lunch. At American
Creek we got a large tomato can outside of
a miner's cabin, and the Harvard man offered to
do the brewing.</p>

<p>"How much shall I put in?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," was the answer.</p>

<p>He took a tremendous handful. "Is this too
much?" he asked, apologetically. "You see, I
haven't had tea for three months, and I feel like
having a good strong cup." We assured him that
the strength of the drink was to be limited only
by his own desires. He was tempted to another
handful, and so little by little, till half the package
was in the can. When he was satisfied, we
told him to keep the remaining half pound for the
next time. He was disappointed.</p>

<p>"If I had known you intended giving it to me,"
he replied, "I wouldn't have used so much." We
drank the tea eagerly, for we were tired, but my
head spun afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>There were some paying claims already on this
creek&mdash;it was a little stream which one could leap
at almost any point&mdash;and on the day we arrived
we saw the clean-up in one of them. It was very
dazzling to see the coarse gold that was scraped
from the riffles of the sluice-boxes into the baking-powder
cans which were used to store it. There
was gold of all sizes, from fine dust up to pieces
as big as pumpkin seed; but this was the result
of a week's work of several men, and much time
had been spent in getting the claim ready before
work could begin. Still, the results were very
good, the clean-up amounting, I was told, to
"thirty dollars to the shovel"&mdash;that is, thirty
dollars a day to each man shovelling gravel into
the sluices.</p>

<p>On the edge of the stream the rock, a rusty
slate, lay loosely; one of the miners was thrusting
his pick among the pieces curiously, and on
turning one over showed the crevice beneath filled
with flat pieces of yellow gold of all sizes. They
were very thin and probably worth only about
five dollars in all, but lying as they did the sight
was enough to give one the gold fever, if he did
not yet have it. The Harvard man and his companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
were immediately seized with a violent
attack, and set off down the stream to stake out
claims, meanwhile talking over plans of wintering
here, so as to be early on the ground the next
spring.</p>

<p>I slept on the floor of a miner's cabin that
night and the next morning made my way back
to our camp on the Yukon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
THE BIRCH CREEK DIGGINGS.</h2>


<p>The next night we reached that part of the
river where Circle City was put down on
the map we carried, but not finding it, camped
on a gravelly beach beneath a timbered bluff.
When we went up the bluff to get wood for our
fire the mosquitoes fairly drove us back and continued
bothering us all night, biting through our
blankets and giving us very little peace, though
we slept with our hats, veils, and gloves on.
We afterwards found that Circle City had at first
been actually started at about this point, but
was soon afterwards moved further down, to
where we found it the next day.</p>

<p>We had been looking forward to our arrival in
this place for several reasons, one of which was
that we had had no fresh meat for over a month,
and hoped to find moose or caribou for sale.
As our boat came around the bend and approached
the settlement of log huts dignified by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the name of Circle City, we noticed quite a large
number of people crowding down to the shore to
meet us, and as soon as we got within hailing
distance one of the foremost yelled out:</p>

<p>"Got any moose meat?"</p>

<p>When we answered "No," the crowd immediately
dispersed and we did not need to
inquire about the supply of fresh meat in
camp.</p>

<p>We landed in front of the Alaska Commercial
Company's store, kept by Jack McQuesten. On
jumping ashore, I went up immediately, in search
of information, and as I stepped in I heard my
name called in a loud voice. I answered promptly
"Here," with no idea of what was wanted, for
there was a large crowd in the store; but from
the centre of the room something was passed from
hand to hand towards me, which proved to be a
package of letters from home&mdash;the first news I
had received for over two months. On inquiry
I found that the mail up the river had just arrived,
and the storekeeper, who was also postmaster
<i>ex officio</i>, had begun calling out the addresses
on the letters to the expectant crowd
of miners, and had got to my name as I entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the door&mdash;a coincidence, I suppose, but surely a
pleasant and striking one.</p>

<p>We obtained lodgings in a log house, large for
Circle City, since it contained two rooms. It
was already occupied by two customhouse officers,
the only representatives of Uncle Sam
whom we encountered in the whole region. One
room had been used as a storeroom and carpenter-shop,
and here, on the shavings, we spread out
our blankets and made ourselves at home.</p>

<p>The building had first been built as a church
by missionaries, but as they were absent for some
time after its completion, one room was fitted up
with a bar by a newly arrived enterprising liquor-dealer,
till the officers, armed in their turn with
the full sanction of the church, turned the building
into a customhouse and hoisted the American
flag, on a pole fashioned out of a slim spruce by
the customs officer himself. The officers, when
we came there, were sleeping days and working
nights on the trail of some whisky smugglers who
were in the habit of bringing liquor down the
river from Canadian territory, in defiance of the
American laws.</p>

<p>There were only a few hundred men in Circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
City at this time, most of the miners being
away at the diggings, for this was one of the
busiest times of the year. These diggings were
sixty miles from the camp, and were only to
be reached by a foot trail which led through
wood and swamp. Several newcomers in the
country were camped around the post, waiting
for cooler weather before starting out on the trail,
for the mosquitoes, they said, were frightful. It
was said that nobody had been on the trail for
two weeks, on this account, and blood-curdling
stories were told of the torments of some that
had dared to try, and how strong men had sat
down on the trail to sob, quite unable to withstand
the pest. However, we had seen mosquitoes
before, and the next morning struck out
for the trail.</p>

<p>It was called a wagon road, the brush and
trees having been cut out sufficiently wide for a
wagon to pass; taken as a footpath, however, it
was just fair. The mosquitoes were actually in
clouds; they were of enormous size, and had
vigorous appetites. It was hot, too, so that their
bites smarted worse than usual. The twelve
miles, which the trail as far as the crossing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Birch Creek had been said to be, lengthened out
into an actual fifteen, over low rolling country,
till we descended a sharp bluff to the stream.
Here a hail brought a boatman across to ferry us
to the other side, where there stood two low log
houses facing one another, and connected overhead
by their projecting log roofs.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">On the Tramp Again.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This was the Twelve Mile Cache, a road-house
for miners, and here we spent the night. Each
of the buildings contained but a single room, one
house being used as a sleeping apartment, the
other as kitchen and dining-room. The host had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
no chairs to offer us, but only long benches; and
there were boxes and stumps for those who
could not find room on the benches, which were
shorter than the tables. We ate out of tin
dishes and had only the regulation bacon, beans
and apple-sauce, yet it was with a curious feeling
that we sat down to the meal and got up from it,
as if we were enjoying a little bit of luxury&mdash;for
so it seemed to us then. There were eleven of us
who slept in the building which had been set
apart for sleeping; we all provided our own
blankets and slept on the floor, which was no
other than the earth, and was so full of humps
and hollows, and projecting sharp sticks where
saplings had been cut off, that one or the other
of the company was in misery nearly all night, and
roused the others with his cursings and growling.
The eight who were not of our party were miners
returning from the diggings with their season's
earnings of gold in the packs strapped to
their backs; they all carried big revolvers and
were on the lookout for possible highwaymen.</p>

<p>On getting up we washed in the stream, ate
breakfast, and prepared to start out again. In
the fine, bright morning light we noticed a sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
nailed up on the dining cabin, which we had not
seen in the dusk of the preceding evening. It
was a notice to thieves, and a specimen of miners'
law in this rough country.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">NOTICE.</div>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">To Whom it may Concern.</span></div>

<p><i>At a general meeting of miners held in Circle
City it was the unanimous Verdict that all thieving
and stealing shall be punished by <span class="smcap">Whipping
at the Post and Banishment from the
Country</span>, the severity of the whipping and the
guilt of the accused to be determined by the Jury.</i></p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">So All Thieves Beware.</span></div>

</blockquote>

<p>Our packs were about twenty-five pounds each,
and contained blankets, a little corned beef and
crackers, and a few other necessities: they were
heavy enough before the day was over. From
Twelve Mile Cache to the diggings we travelled
over what was called the Hog'em trail, since it
led to the gulch of that name: it ran for the
whole distance through a swamp, and was said
to be a very good trail in winter&mdash;in summer it
was vile. We had been informed of a way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
which branched off from the Hog'em route and
ran over drier ground to a road-house called the
"Central House," but we were unable to pick up
this; and we discovered afterwards that it had
been blazed from the Central House, but that
the blazing had been discontinued two or three
miles before reaching the junction of the Hog'em
trail, the axe-man having got tired, or having
gone home for his dinner and forgotten to come
back. So people like ourselves, starting for the
diggings, invariably followed the Hog'em trail,
whether they would or not, and those coming
out of the diggings and returning by way of the
Central House, followed the blazes through the
woods till they stopped, and then wandered
ahead blindly, often getting lost.</p>

<p>The Hog'em trail was a continuous bed of
black, soft, stinking, sticky mud, for it had been
well travelled over. At times there was thick
moss; and again broad pools of water of uncertain
depth, with mud bottoms, to be waded
through; and long stretches covered with "nigger-heads."
We walked twelve miles of this
trail without stopping or eating, for the mosquitoes
were bloodthirsty, and even hunger can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
hardly tempt a man to bestride a "nigger-head"
and lunch under such conditions. We arrived at
night at what was called the "Jump-Off,"&mdash;a
sharp descent which succeeded a gradual rise&mdash;where
we found two sturdy men, both old guides
from the Adirondacks, engaged in felling the
trees which grew on the margin of the stream, and
piling them into a log house. This they intended
to use as a road-house, for the travel here was
considerable, especially in the winter. In the
meantime they were living in a tent, yet maintained
a sort of hostelry for travellers, in that
they dispensed meals to them. As soon as they
were through with the big log they were getting
into place when we arrived, they built a fire on
the ground and cooked supper, after which we
were invited to spread our blankets, with the
stars and the grey sky for a shelter. They made
some apologies at not being able to offer us a tent&mdash;theirs
was a tiny affair,&mdash;and promised better
accommodations if we would come back a
month from then, when the cabin would be
finished and the chinks neatly plugged with muck
and moss.</p>

<p>The next day's journey was again twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
miles, over about the same kind of trail. Crossing
a sluggish stream which was being converted
into a swamp by encroaching vegetation, we
were obliged to wade nearly waist deep, and then
our feet rested on such oozy and sinking mud that
we did not know but the next moment we might
disappear from sight entirely. Further on, the
trail ran fair into a small lake, whose shores we
had to skirt. There was no trail around, but much
burnt and felled timber lay everywhere, and
climbing over this, balancing our packs in the
meantime, was "such fun." Sometimes we would
jump down from a high log, and, slipping a little,
our packs would turn us around in the air, and
we would fall on our backs, sprawling like turtles,
and often unable to get out of our awkward position
without help from our comrades.</p>

<p>Reedy lakes such as this, fringed with moss
and coarse grass, with stunted spruce a little distance
away, are common through this swampy
country, and have something of the picturesque
about them. The surrounding vegetation is very
abundant. Excellent cranberries are found, bright
red in color and small in size; and on a little
drier ground blue-berries nourish. Raspberries
of good size, although borne on bushes usually
not more than two or three inches high, are also
here; and red and black currants.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the second day we arrived at
Hog'em Junction, where the Hog'em trail unites
with that leading off to the other gulches where
gold is found. Here was the largest road-house
we had seen. There were fifteen or twenty men
hanging about, mostly miners returning or going
to the diggings, and a professional hunter&mdash;a sort
of wild man, who told thrilling stories of fighting
bears.</p>

<p>One of the structures we saw here was called
the dog-corral and was a big enclosure built of
logs. Dogs were used to carry most of the provisions
to the Birch Creek diggings from Circle
City, freighting beginning as soon as the snow
fell and everything froze hard. There was a
pack of these animals around the inn&mdash;a sneaking,
cringing, hungry lot, rarely barking at intruders
or strangers, and easily cowed by a man,
but very prone to fight among themselves. They
were all Indian dogs, and were of two varieties;
one long-haired, called Mahlemut, from the fact
that its home is among the Mahlemut Eskimo of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the lower Yukon; the other short-haired, and
stouter. Both breeds are of large size, and a
good dog is capable of pulling as much as 400
pounds on a sleigh, when the snow is very good,
and the weather not too cold. The dog-corral is
used to put the sleighs in when the freighter arrives,
and the dogs are left outside, to keep them
away from the provisions. The winter price for
freight from Circle City was seven cents per
pound; in summer it was forty.</p>

<p>We ate breakfast and supper at Hog'em Junction,
paying a dollar apiece for the meals; and
when we learned that the bacon which was
served to us had cost sixty-five cents a pound, the
charge did not seem too much. No good bacon
was to be had, that which we ate being decidedly
strong; and even this kind had to be hunted after
at this time of the year. Not only was food
very high in the diggings, but it could not always
be bought, so that in the winter, when
freighting was cheap, enough could not often be
obtained to last through the next summer, and
the miners had to wait for the steamer to come
up the Yukon. The Hog'em Junction innkeeper
paid twenty dollars for a case of evaporated fruit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
such as cost a dollar in San Francisco; condensed
milk was one dollar a can, and sugar eighty-five
cents a pound. The previous winter beans
brought one dollar a pound, and butter two and
a half dollars a roll. In summer all prices were
those of Circle City, plus forty cents freighting,
plus ten cents handling. So a sack of potatoes,
which I was told would cost twenty-five cents in
the state of Washington, cost here eighty-five
dollars. Even in Circle City the prices, though
comparatively low, were not exactly what people
would expect at a bargain counter in one of
our cities. Winchester rifles were sold for fifty
dollars apiece, and calico brought fifty cents a
yard. Luckily there were few women folks in
the country at that time!</p>

<p>Of the Hog'em Junction Inn I have little distinct
recollection except concerning the meals.
We were so hungry when we reached there that
the food question was indelibly branded on our
memory. For the rest I remember that when
supper was cleared away, the guests wrapped
themselves in their private blankets and lay
down anywhere they thought best. There was
a log outhouse with some rude bunks filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with straw, for those who preferred, so in a
short time we were stowed away with truly
mediæval simplicity, to sleep heavily until the
summons came to breakfast,&mdash;for there were no
"hotel hours" for lazy guests at this inn, and he
who did not turn out for a seven o'clock breakfast
could go without.</p>

<p>We three separated on leaving here, each
taking a different trail, so that we might see all
of the gulches in a short space of time. I shouldered
my blankets and after a seven mile tramp
through the brush came to the foot of Hog'em
Gulch, which was in a deep valley in the hills
that now rose above the plain. This gulch derived
its name from the fact that its discoverer
tried to <i>hog</i> all the claims for himself, taking up
some for his wife, his wife's brother, his brother,
and the niece of his wife's particular friend;
even, it is said, inventing fictitious personages
that he might stake out claims for them. The
other miners disappointed him in his schemes for
gain, and they contemptuously called the creek
"Hog'em." Afterwards a faction of the claim-owners
proposed to change the name to Deadwood,
claiming that it sounded better and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
also appropriate, inasmuch as they had got that
variety of timber on the schemer. It was somewhat
unkindly asserted, however, by those who
were not residents of the gulch, that the first
name was always the most appropriate, since the
spirit of the discoverer seemed to have gone
down to his successors.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, I noticed a remarkable difference
between the men whom I found working
their claims along the creek and the miners of
Forty Mile. Nobody showed the slightest hospitality
or friendliness, except one man on the
lower creek, who invited me to share his little
tent at night. He had not enough blankets to
keep him warm, so I added mine, and beneath
them both we two slept very comfortably. In
the morning he cooked a very simple meal over
a tiny fire outside of the tent&mdash;wood was scarce
along here&mdash;and invited me, with little talk, to
partake of it with him. He was evidently far
from happy in this cheerless existence; he was
working for wages, which, to be sure, were ten
dollars a day, but with provisions as high as they
were this was nothing much, and the work was
so hard that, great stalwart man as he was, he
had lost thirty pounds since he had begun. He
would have liked to return to the States, for he
was somewhat discouraged, but he could not
save enough money to pay for the expensive
passage out. I hope he has struck it rich since
then and brought back to his wife and babies the
fortune he went to seek!</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>After I left this silent man, I found none who
showed much interest. Some of them were a
little curious as to what I was doing, but most
of them were fiercely and feverishly working to
make the most of the hours and weeks which
remained of the mining season; the run of gold
was ordinarily very good, and all were anxious
to make as good a final clean-up as possible. At
dinner-time everybody rushed to their meal, and
I sat down by the side of the trail, ate stale
corned beef, broken crackers, and drank the
creek water. When I was half-way through I
observed two young men in a tent munching
their meal, but watching me; and a sort of
righteous indignation came upon me, as must
always seize the poor when he beholds the abundance
of the rich man's table. I walked into the
tent and asked for a share of their dinner. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
gave me a place, but so surlily that I said hotly,
"See here, I'll pay you for this dinner, so don't
be so stingy about it." The offer to pay was an
insult to the miner's tradition and one of them
growled out,</p>

<p>"None of that kind of talk, d'ye hear? You're
welcome to whatever we've got, and don't yer
forget it! Only there's been a good many bums
along here lately, and we was getting tired of
them."</p>

<p>After this they were pleasanter, although I
could not help reflecting that I was actually a
bum, as they put it, and mentally pitied the professional
tramp, if his evil destiny should ever
lead him into the Yukon country.</p>

<p>As it grew near nightfall I climbed out of the
gulch, and, crossing the ridge, dropped down
into Greenhorn Gulch, which, with its neighbor
Tinhorn Gulch, form depressions parallel to
Hog'em. There was only one claim working
here, and on this the supply of water was so
scarce that not much washing could be done.
The people seemed like those of Hog'em Gulch,
and took little notice of strangers. Having
learned a new code of manners on Birch Creek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
however, I walked into the cabin where one of
the claim owners was getting supper. He was
a short, powerful, fierce-eyed man, who never
smiled, and spoke with an almost frenzied earnestness.
He did not speak for some time, however,
but glared suspiciously when I walked in.
I looked at him without nodding, took off my
pack and put it in the corner, sat down on
a stool and fished my pipe out of my pocket.
He glared until he was tired, and then said:
"Hallo!"</p>

<p>"Hallo," I returned, and drawing up to the
table, began working with my specimens and
notebook. Looking up and finding him still regarding
me, I continued: "How's the claim
turning out?"</p>

<p>"Pretty fair!" he growled. "What in h&mdash;l
are <i>you</i> reportin' for?" "Uncle Sam," I replied.
He was from the moonshine district of Tennessee,
and this was no recommendation to him, so he
kept his eye on me. Presently his "pardner"
came in and looked at me inquiringly. I spoke
to him quite warmly, as if I was welcoming him
to the cabin. Soon supper was ready, and the
fierce-eyed moonshiner looked at me four or five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
times, then said, beckoning me to the table:
"Set up."</p>

<p>After supper the two men crawled into their
bunks; I spread my blankets on the floor. The
Tennessee man poked his head out.</p>

<p>"Goin' to sleep on the floor?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered I. He crawled out and pulled
a caribou hide from the rafters above.</p>

<p>"Lay on that," he said.</p>

<p>When I thanked him, he looked at me suspiciously.</p>

<p>In the morning I sat down to breakfast without
being asked, and ate enormously and silently.
The moonshiner warmed up at this.</p>

<p>"You're a better sort of feller than I thought
at first," he said; "I thought you was goin' to
be one of them d&mdash;d polite fellers."</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, no; not me," I replied, "you're
thinkin' of some one else, I reckon?"</p>

<p>After breakfast he showed me his gold dust;
a little flat piece interested me, and I said,
"Gimme that, I'll pay yer; what's it worth?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," he replied. "Yer can take it."</p>

<p>Afterwards I shouldered my pack and made
for the door; when I got there I stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and looked over my shoulder and said, "So
long!"</p>

<p>"So long to <i>you</i>!" he answered, looking after
me with more human interest than I had previously
seen in him. "Stop here when you come
this way again."</p>

<p>I climbed out of the gulch and walked along
the mountain ridge for a while, encountering,
whenever there was no wind, swarms of the tiny
gnats which the miners often dread worse than
the mosquitoes. They are so numerous as actually
to obscure the sun in places and they fill
nose, ears, and eyes; there is no escape from
them, for they are so small that they go through
the meshes of a mosquito net with the greatest
ease. On top of the ridge, where the wind blew,
they disappeared. As I walked along here I
met a prospector, and after a friendly talk with
him, dropped down another mountain-side to the
bed of Independence Creek, and followed that to
the junction of Mammoth Creek, so called from
the number of bones of the extinct elephant, or
mammoth, which are buried there. Wading
across a swamp, I found in the brush another
road-house, the Mammoth Junction. This was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
large log building containing a single room,
which served as kitchen, dining-room, parlor,
general bedroom, and barroom. At first I was
the only guest, but afterwards a prospector arrived
from a hard trip to the Tanana, and he
related his experiences; how he had shot three
bears, seven caribou, and a moose in seven days.
He was a tall, well-built Cape Bretoner, Dick
McDonald by name. When he got tired of
talking I spread my blankets on the floor (for
which privilege I paid fifty cents) and gladly
stowed myself away for the night.</p>

<p>The next day a tramp of seventeen miles
brought me to the Central House, on the way
home from the diggings; for although our rendezvous
should have been at Mammoth Junction,
yet I concluded to wait for the others at Circle
City. The trail was very bad, and during the
first part of the journey the gnats were as annoying
as they had been on the mountains the day
before. There were millions of them. During
the last part the mosquitoes got the upper hand,
and gave me the strictest attention.</p>

<p>"Ah," I soliloquized, perspiring freely and
tugging at my pack straps like a jaded horse at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
his harness, "the trials of an Alaskan pioneer!
Stumbling and staggering through mud knee-deep,
and through nigger-heads, wading streams,
fighting gnats and mosquitoes, suffering often
from hunger and thirst, and rolling into one's
sole pair of blankets under the frosty stars or the
rain-clouds!"</p>

<p>When my views were thus gloomy, a smell
of smoke came to my nostrils, and crossing a
little stream on a fallen tree, I came to the
friendly inn I was seeking.</p>

<p>The next morning, at five o'clock by my
watch and eight by the host's, (it is unnecessary
to observe that there was no standard time
used in the Birch Creek district) I started for
Twelve Mile Cache. The first part of the trail
was fairly well worn, but was covered with small
dead trees which had fallen across it, necessitating
the continual lifting of the feet and the taking of
irregular steps. Ten miles of this was enough to
make one very weary. I lunched on my stale
corned beef and cracker crumbs, and drank from
a little creek that I crossed. Soon after this,
I came to a place where a newly blazed trail,
leading to the Twelve Mile Cache, diverged from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the older path, which ran up over the mountains.
Deciding to take the newer route, I found it very
hard walking, especially as my feet were clad in
the Eskimo sealskin boot, or makalok, which are
soft and offer little protection. Much of the road
lay among immense untrodden nigger-heads and
in swampy brush, where the sticks which had
been cut off in making the trail stuck up three
or four inches above the ground, just convenient
for stubbing the toe; and yet the long grass quite
concealed them, so they could not be avoided.
Afterwards the trail struck into an old winter
sleighing road, and I got on more rapidly for a
few miles; but the mosquitoes had increased to
legions and stung painfully. The gnats and flies
were also numerous, the big deer flies biting my
ears where the mosquito netting rested on them,
till they were bloody.</p>

<p>At about four o'clock the cut trail came to an
end, and here was a stick pointing into the
woods, inscribed:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Foller thes blaies to Twelv Mill
House. Six Mills to Twelv Mill House 9
Mills Central House.</span>"</p>

<p>The "blaies" (blazes) had been newly cut, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
as I started to follow them, it seemed that they
led through the thickest of the brush, where it
was almost impossible to fight one's way, especially
with a pack, which protrudes on both
sides of the shoulders, and which often wedges
one firmly between two saplings. Soon the
blazes grew further and further apart; after
leaving one it often took ten minutes to find the
next, scouting around everywhere in the tangle
of bushes. The mosquitoes kept up their attacks,
and my head began to ache splittingly, partly
from their bites and partly from the jerking
of the head strap of my pack in my struggles
through the brush.</p>

<p>At last in despair I abandoned the attempt to
follow the blazes, and turning square away from
them, struck off in the direction where I knew
the Hog'em Junction trail, by which we had
reached the diggings, must lie, steering by my
compass. Very soon I found better walking,&mdash;comparatively
open swampy patches, with alder
thickets between&mdash;and in half a mile I cut into
the trail I was seeking. Three miles of this trail
brought me to Twelve Mile Cache, after one of
the hardest days I had had in Alaska. Compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
with such a trip as this the dreaded Chilkoot Pass
was not so formidable, after all. The entire
distance I had travelled was twenty-seven miles.
I had counted my paces through it all, and they
tallied with the count of my companions, who
came on later.</p>

<p>For supper at Twelve Mile Cache we had fresh
fish,&mdash;pike and Arctic trout&mdash;taken from a trap
in the river, and fresh vegetables raised on the
roof, which was covered with a luxuriant garden.
A thick layer of rich loam had been put
on, and the seed dropped into this throve amazingly,
for the fires inside the cabin supplied
warmth, and the plants did not have to fight
against the eternal frost which lies everywhere
a short distance below the surface. The long
glorious sunshine of the northern summer did the
rest, and splendid potatoes, rutabagas, cabbages,
beets, and lettuce were the results.</p>

<p>The fifteen miles back to Circle City the next
day was a very weary walk, for my overwork on
the day before had left me tired out. The mosquitoes
were maddening on the last part of the
trail, in spite of gloves and veil. On getting into
Circle City, however, I was kindly welcomed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
my friends, the customs officers, and given a
square meal. The room we had occupied as a
bedroom had, in the short time since we had left,
been put to still other uses. A newly arrived
physician was using it for a laboratory, and a
man who had brought a scow load of merchandise
down the Yukon was storing his stuff in the same
room. Also a red-sweatered young man turned
up who said he had been told to sleep here, but
the customs officers kicked him out and he went
and slept under an upturned boat on the bank.
After a bath I felt refreshed, but glancing into a
looking-glass for the first time for many a day,
I saw that my appearance was still against me.
I was a long-haired, bushy-bearded, ragged, belted
and knifed wild man, not fair to look upon.</p>

<p>I spent the next day in wandering around town
in a desultory fashion, and on returning to the
customhouse found the door locked. When I
knocked I was challenged and then cautiously
admitted: on entering I was surprised to see the
officers with their rifles ready for use alongside
of them. Ross lifted up the strip of calico which
formed a curtain hiding the space under the bed
and disclosed two good-sized kegs. These he told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
me he and Wendling (the other officer) had seized
while we were away. It was, and is, entirely illegal
to bring liquor into the territory of Alaska,
and this law and its attendant features have
brought about much of the dishonesty and corruption
which have made the inside history of
Alaskan government since its acquisition by
Americans such a dismal one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Custom House at Circle City.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In Circle City liquor was freely brought down
the river from the British side of the boundary.
The first customs inspector was said to have been
a notorious rascal, who had not only winked at
the bringing in of liquor, but had taken a hand
in the trade himself. The present representatives
of the government, however, seemed to
wish to do their duty, and their watching nights
and sleeping days had finally resulted in their
trapping the smugglers as they were landing, and
they had captured the whisky and had brought
it to the customhouse, where the whole camp
knew it to be. The whole camp was interested
in it, moreover, for it had been whisky-dry; and
the feeling towards the officers was probably
none of the best in any quarter, although most
recognized that they were simply doing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
duty. At the enormously high prices which
prevailed, these two kegs were worth several
thousand dollars, and so were valuable booty.
Therefore, a plot had been hatched to recover
the liquor, and this plot had come to the
officers' ears a few hours before the <i>coup</i> was to
have taken place. Hence the caution and warlike
preparations which greeted me. The men
from whom the whisky had been taken were
the leaders in the scheme, and they had also
enlisted several miners, among them a gigantic
fellow who called himself "Caribou Bill," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
whom I had met on the trail to the diggings.
Bill gave the thing away by going to a saloon-keeper
and trying to borrow a second revolver&mdash;he
already had one. On being questioned as
to why he wanted it, he took the saloon-keeper
into his confidence. The saloon-keeper told a
friend of his, who being also a friend of one of
the customs officers, cautioned him.</p>

<p>Both of the officers advised me to go elsewhere
till the trouble was over, but reflecting that I
was their guest and so under obligations to them,
and also that I was an officer of Uncle Sam, and
was in duty bound to "uphold the government
of the United States by land and sea, against
foreign and domestic enemies" as had been
specified in my oath of office, I decided to remain
with them. Ross hunted up two of his old
friends among the miners and told them he proposed
to resist the attack till the last, and that if
there should be any bloodshed he hoped the camp
would treat him fairly, considering that he had
simply been doing his duty. The miners offered
to stay with us and help in the resistance, but as
we knew their hearts were hardly in their offer
of loyalty, we refused to let them stay. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
them, however, loaned his rifle to Wendling; and
as he went to get it, a couple of forms behind the
house jumped up and ran away. The other
miner, who had also gone out for a moment, returned
with the news that he had seen four men
skulking behind the bank which lay in front of
the house.</p>

<p>The plan of the smugglers and their friends,
as Ross had learned it, was to come to the door
of the cabin and knock. When the officer went
to the door to open it, he would be covered with
a revolver, and the second officer with another,
and the whisky would be rolled out and over the
bank into a boat which would convey it up the
river into a new hiding-place. If the officers resisted
they would be shot and the whisky taken
just the same. The plan we determined upon
was to leave the door unlocked, so that when the
expected knock should come we would not have
to go to the door to open it, but would call out
"Come in" without stirring. I had my post on
a box near the wall directly opposite the door,
while Ross sat in the darkness close by the window,
so that when the knocker should enter he
would find the muzzles of repeating rifles levelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
at him from two opposite directions, and be
invited to drop his fire-arms and surrender.
Wendling was in the other room watching
the second door and window, but we did not
expect the attack to be made there, since the
smugglers must know very well that the whisky
was in the officers' living-room, where we
were.</p>

<p>Directly after we had taken our places a man
came and stood twenty yards in front of the
cabin in the dusk, and beckoned. Ross went out
to him, and a long talk ensued, which ended by
the officer returning. He said that the man had
told him that we were three against many, and
that they were bound to get the whisky anyway,
since it was theirs and they would fight for
it; so if Ross would simply yield without fighting
it would save us. At the same time they
would be willing to pay him a nice little sum as
a plaster wherewith to heal his wounded dignity.
Ross had replied that they had mistaken their
man; whereupon he was informed that he must
take the consequences. So he returned, and we
waited with tense nerves, in momentary expectation
of an attack, our eyes strained, our fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
on the triggers of our cocked rifles, our ears listening.</p>

<p>After an hour or more had passed, and no
sound was heard, the suspense began to grow unbearable.
Ross whispered to me, "If them fellers
are coming I wish they'd hurry up, and not
keep us waiting here all night." Shortly afterwards
Wendling, crawling cautiously and silently
around in the other room, knocked down from
some shelf on the wall a pile of tin pans, which
made a terrific rattle and bang; this upset our
tightly-drawn nerves so that we laughed convulsively,
trying to choke down our merriment so
that it could not be heard. Still no noise from
the outside, save that once we heard coughing behind
the logs at the back of the building. Ross,
peering through the window, saw now and then
a shadowy form creeping along the bank in
front; and Wendling, reconnoitring through the
window in the other room, saw other figures
passing around back of the house. And still no
alarm. Sitting bolt upright on my box, I suddenly
caught my head, which was in the act of
falling forward&mdash;caught it with a jerk which
brought my eyes wide open, and at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
horror filled my soul&mdash;I was in danger of falling
asleep! This frightened me so that I kept awake
easily after that. So we waited till the morning
grey brightened in the sky, when finally Ross
remarked: "Well, there's no more danger,
and I'm tired enough to sleep." We rolled
ourselves in our blankets and dropped asleep
without a moment's delay, not waking until
the day was late and Goodrich and Schrader,
just returning from the diggings, pounded on
the door and asked for admission and a bite to
eat.</p>

<p>Concerning the reasons why the raid was given
up, there was much inner history that I never
learned. I suspect that the miners who had offered
to help us afterwards warned the smugglers,
telling them how well we were prepared,
and that this kept them from carrying out their
plans.</p>

<p>The next night a grand ball was gotten up by
the ladies of Circle City, and our bedroom in the
customhouse&mdash;being one of the largest places
available&mdash;was selected as the scene of the dance.
I was requested to write the announcements
of the ball, which I did, and stuck one up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
each of the Companies' stores. They ran as
follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Social Dance.</span><br />
<br />
<i>There will be a <span class="smcap">Social Dance</span><br />
given by the ladies of <span class="smcap">Circle City</span><br />
Wednesday Eve. Aug. 19th,<br />
At the residence of Mr. George Ross.<br />
The supply of ice cream brought up on the<br />
Arctic being exhausted, there will be<br />
no collation.<br />
No rubber boots allowed on the floor.<br />
Dogs must be tied with ribbons in the anteroom.</i><br />
</div>

<p>After the notices were posted, one of the customs
officers came to me in great perturbation
concerning the regulation about rubber boots,
saying that such a restriction would exclude many
desirable and well-meaning gentlemen who would
otherwise be able to attend.</p>

<p>The shavings were swept out of the room and
our beds and other stuff cleared out. Wax candles
were cut up and rubbed on the floor, and by
dusk everything was in readiness. One of the
trading companies donated the candles, which
were stuck up around the room to the extent
of nearly a dozen, and furnished a brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
illumination. The services of a pock-marked
vagabond who was employed around a saloon
and dance-house was secured as director of the
affair, and two miners just in from the gulches
(they had taken only one change of clothes to
the diggings and had not had time to change
them after coming back before going to the
dance), furnished the orchestra, playing very acceptably
on guitar and fiddle. The music was
all classical,&mdash;Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay or the Irish
washerwoman occupying most of the time.
Each of the players was so enthusiastic in his art
that he often entirely forgot his companion, and
would be fiddling away at the closing spasms of
Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay, with perspiring zeal, when
his more rapid partner had finished this tune and
was merrily galloping through</p>

<div class="poem">
"Wuz ye iver inside of an Irishman's shanty?<br />
Wid salt an' peraties an' iverything planty,<br />
A three-legged stool an' a table to match,<br />
And the door of the shanty unlocks wid a latch!"<br />
</div>

<p>The pock-marked director yelled out "<i>Swing</i>
your pardners. <i>Ladies</i> to the left. <i>Forward</i>
and back! <i>Alleman left!</i> etc.," loud above the
squeak of the stringed instruments. The couples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
gyrated in eccentric curves around in obedience
to the cries; the candles flickered in the draft
from the open door; and a row of miners too
bashful to dance, or who could find no partners,
sat on boxes close to the wall, hunched up their
legs and spit tobacco-juice, until the middle
of the floor was a sort of an island. In short, it
was the most brilliant affair Circle City had ever
witnessed; even the Indians who crowded around
the open door and peered in over one another's
heads murmured in admiration, and all agreed
that it was a "<i>haioo</i> time", which is equivalent
to saying a rip-roaring time. This was not the
first dance held in the camp. The small but
powerful contingent of ladies of adventure held
nightly dances, but this was the first where the
ladies were respectable.</p>

<p>We were hard put to it for finery. The dancer
of our party, having, as we explained to him, to
bear in a way the brunt of the social duties for
us all, bought a new pair of blue overalls, much
too large for him; these he turned up at the bottom,
and braced up mightily, so that they covered
many shortcomings; then he bought a
green and yellow abomination of a necktie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
which had been designed to catch the heathen
fancy of the natives, plastered his hair down,
and worried the tangles out of his beard. After
this he was the beau of the evening, the gayest
of the gay, being snubbed by only one woman,
and she of doubtful reputation, as we consolingly
reminded him.</p>

<p>The men in general wore the most varied
costumes, high boots being the prevailing style,
though even the rubber boots I had been so
near forbidding were seen; then one might
notice the Indian moccasins, and the sealskin
makalok, which had been brought up from the
Eskimos on the lower Yukon. Flannel shirts
without coat or vests were the rule, for the night
was warm. Here and there was a corduroy
coat, or a mackinaw checked with red and green
squares four inches across, but the wearers of
them suffered for their vanity. In striking and
almost ridiculous contrast to this picturesque
attire was the black cutaway suit and polished
shoes of the baker who had just arrived on a
Yukon steamer from St. Michael's.</p>

<p>After midnight we had cake, which the ladies
had brought with them, and considering the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that they had so little material for cooking, the
variety and excellence were remarkable. Underneath
the festive board which covered the bed
still lay concealed the two kegs of whisky
which we had watched over the night before.
It was at a late hour (to adopt country newspaper
phraseology) that the company broke up,
loud in their praises of the success of the fête,
and returned to their respective homes. We
then rolled our blankets out upon the waxed
floor, and lay down for another night.</p>

<p>The same day a river steamer had arrived in
Circle City from the lower Yukon, bringing our
trunks to us, which we had sent around by water
from Seattle. These were well filled with a
goodly outfit for the winter, for we had expected
that our work would take us two seasons. We
had, however, gotten on twice as well as we had
expected, and already saw the end of our task
ahead, so there was nothing to hinder us from
going out this same fall. The freight on our
three trunks from Seattle was one hundred and
eighty dollars, and we did not feel justified in
expending a like sum to carry them back. We
therefore determined to sell our things, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
day after the party I wrote out notices announcing
an auction to be held in the room where we
had danced.</p>

<p>Wendling volunteered to act as auctioneer,
provided he were allowed to work in as part of
our effects several hundred pounds of tobacco
which he had brought up as a speculation. At
seven o'clock we started in, having borrowed a
pair of gold-scales for the sake of transacting the
financial part of the business, for almost the sole
currency of the camp was gold dust. Not being
ourselves accustomed to the delicate operation of
weighing, we persuaded some of the miners to do
it for us, so that there should be no question as
to fairness. At eight the miners began leaving
and we were told that a miners' meeting had
been called, so we adjourned for an hour, and attended
the gathering.</p>

<p>The miners' meeting was the sole legislative,
judiciary and executive body in these little republics.
To settle any question whatever, any
one had the right to call such a council, which
brought the issue to a summary close. This one
was held in the open air close to the river bank
in front of the Company's store. The miners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
flocked together and conversed in groups. Nobody
knew who had called the meeting or why;
but presently some grew impatient, remarking:
"Let's have the meeting. Who's for chairman?"</p>

<p>One man answered: "What's the matter
with Sandy Jim for chairman? Here he is, just
in from the diggings! Come over here, Jim!"</p>

<p>"Second the motion, somebody. Any body
object to Sandy Jim?" said the first speaker.
"Climb up on the box, Sandy, my boy."</p>

<p>Sandy Jim was a slender, blonde young man
with quiet manners, and a style of speech which
told of a good education. He mounted the box
in the centre of the crowd, and having thus obtained
a commanding position, he began, with
correct parliamentary methods, to bring about
order. Having requested silence, he inquired
who had called the meeting. A man who acted
as town clerk or some similar officer in the
miners' vague system of government, explained
that he had issued the call, to inform the miners
that some one had settled upon a piece of land
that had been set aside for town purposes, and,
in spite of warnings to the contrary, was proceeding
to erect a log house upon it; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the tent temporarily occupied by the individual
mentioned was already pitched upon the lot.
As an officer of the camp he had felt in duty
bound to call a meeting and let the boys decide
what was to be done. Instantly there was a rattle
of contradictory suggestions, everybody addressing
everybody else, and forgetting to turn to
the chairman. Finally a tall man with a heavy
black beard mounted the box and addressed the
meeting, arguing coldly and logically that the
person had acted in defiance of the miners' meeting,
which was the only law they had; and proposing
that he be fined, and in case he resisted
further, put in a boat and set floating down the
Yukon. There was a general murmur of approval,
and the chairman, putting the question to
a vote, found a fairly unanimous verdict in favor
of the speaker's suggestion.</p>

<p>"Before I appoint a committee," said the chairman,
"the meeting should know who the person
is who has to be dealt with, and I will ask the
gentleman who called the meeting to give the
information."</p>

<p>The clerk of the camp elbowed his way forward
a little. "I've been trying to get a word in for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
a long time," he said. "I don't think we ought
to be so hard in this case. You all know the
person&mdash;it's Black Kitty. She's a woman, even
if she <i>is</i> black and a fighter, and she's alone and
working for a living. I move we go it easy."</p>

<p>Amid another buzz the tall bearded man got
up and remarked: "That's different. I don't
think any one wanted to quarrel with a woman,
and a black one at that." This was only his way
of expressing it, for he certainly did not mean
that he would rather have quarrelled with a white
woman. "Anyhow, there's plenty of land for
public purposes out there in the brush, and I
move an amendment that we let Kitty alone!"</p>

<p>In defiance of all parliamentary usage, this
amendment was accepted with a chorus of approval
by the crowd, which, satisfied with itself,
scattered almost before the chairman could make
himself heard, sanctioning and proclaiming valid
the last expression of opinion.</p>

<p>Most of the miners returned to our cabin,
where the auction began again, and lasted till
twelve o'clock, by which time we had sold nearly
everything we cared to, at prices a little above
cost in Seattle. Wendling also succeeded in disposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of a hundred pounds of his tobacco, putting
up lots every now and then. Some miners
expressed surprise to Ross that we should use so
much tobacco, and Ross winked and put his
finger on his nose and said, "You don't know
the inside, that's all. See that little feller over
there?" indicating me. "That little feller chews
a pound a day. Yes, sir! He eats it sometimes."</p>

<p>The next morning we weighed out our gold
dust and found it some twenty-five dollars more
than we had any record of, from which we
inferred that the miners who had so kindly
superintended the weighing of the various sums
paid in had been a little generous, and always
given full weight. When we got to San
Francisco, and presented our gold dust at the
mint, where it was weighed accurately, we
received several dollars more for it than we made
it from our final weighing; so it appears that the
Yukon miner's currency is none of the most
accurate. Stories were told around camp, of
barkeepers who panned the sawdust on their
floor and made good wages at it; and it was
alleged that one had a strip of carpet on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
counter, into which he let fall a trifle of gold
dust every time he took a pinch for a drink of
whisky, and at the end of the day, by taking up
his carpet and shaking it, he had a nice little sum
over his day's earnings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
THE MYNOOK CREEK DIGGINGS.</h2>


<p>The next day, the 21st of August, we loaded
up the Skookum again, and dropped away
from Circle City with the current. The customs
officers were short of rice, but they sent a
pair of old slippers flying after us as we moved
away; and several of the ladies who had been at
the dance stood on the bank and waved us adieu.
Soon the river broadened out, with many channels
flowing amid a maze of low wooded islands.
This was the beginning of the great Yukon
Flats, which stretch in dreary monotony for so
many miles below Circle City.</p>

<p>The wind blew strong, with gusts of rain, in
the morning, and increased to a gale which lasted
nearly all day. The proper channel was difficult
to determine, and we were often sucked into
some little channel or slough (pronounced
"sloo"), only to find our way back again, after
a long circuit, to the larger body of water, at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
place near where we had left it. No hills were
visible in any direction&mdash;nothing but the waste of
waters, the sandspits, and the level wooded islands
and banks. At night we reached Fort Yukon, a
trading post, which is situated at the junction of
the Porcupine with the Yukon; we had made the
distance from Circle City, estimated at about
eighty miles, in sixteen hours. So bewildering
are the various channels here that one would
hardly suspect that any stream entered the
Yukon, and the current is so varied and sluggish
that one might easily attempt to ascend the
Porcupine, having the impression that he was
still descending the Yukon&mdash;a delusion that would
be dispelled after the first few miles.</p>

<p>Like other so-called "Forts" in the Alaskan
country, Fort Yukon was simply a rough log
building inhabited by one white man, who had
a scanty stock of very poor provisions, such as
flour and tea, to exchange for skins with the
natives. Around the building the Indians had
made their camp, as usual, a trading-post being
always the nucleus of a dirty and foul-smelling
congregation of natives. From one Indian we
bought a whitefish, and on his presenting it to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
whole, we motioned him to clean it; he did so,
laying the entrails carefully on a board. He
wished tea in exchange for it, and not being
experienced in native trading, we gave him what
we afterwards learned was ten or twelve times
the usual price. We had the best English breakfast
tea, and he was at first doubtful at this, having
seen only the cheap black tea always sold to
the natives; but he was vastly pleased at the
quantity, and, laughing delightedly, proceeded to
"treat" his friends on the occasion of his good
fortune, by handing around the raw entrails of
the fish, which they divided and ate without
further ceremony.</p>

<p>Not liking to sleep within reach of the Indian
dogs, who are very dangerous enemies to one's
bacon, we dropped down the river half a mile
below the post and made camp in a spruce grove&mdash;a
beautiful spot, cool, and free from mosquitoes.</p>

<p>The next day we were still in the flats. There
was a high wind blowing and the sky was spotted
with curious clouds. Some were like cauliflowers
in form; others were funnel-shaped; and
still others were dark, with long black tentacles
of rain. Whenever these tentacles passed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the river in a direction against the current, an
ugly chop sea was the result, and our boat, stout
dory though she was, shipped water in some of
these places.</p>

<p>Floating down through the network of channels
we suddenly ran hard upon a sand-bar,
and it took a couple of hours' work to get us
off, for as soon as we were lodged the sand
which the Yukon waters carry began settling
round the boat and banking it in, making
it the hardest work imaginable to move it.
While we were tugging and groaning in our
efforts, a steamer&mdash;the Arctic&mdash;came down the
river behind us, and being steered by experienced
Indian pilots, struck the right channel only a
short distance from us and floated past triumphantly.
The deck was swarming with miners
who were bound for St. Michael's, and they made
many jocose remarks at our expense, offering to
take word to our friends, and do other favors
for us. We said nothing, though we fumed inwardly.
Finally we succeeded in getting free,
and floated off. Some time afterwards we saw
behind us what appeared to be the smoke of another
steamer; but when we stopped for lunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the craft caught up with us, and proved to be an
ordinary open boat like our own, but with a
Yukon stove made of sheet iron set up in it,
whereon the solitary passenger cooked his dinner
while he floated.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we caught sight of a bona
fide steamer ahead of us, and as we came steadily
closer, it seemed as if she must be stopping;
soon we recognized the Arctic, and saw that the
crew and all the passengers were laboring excitedly
in many ways, trying to get the boat off
the sand-bar on which she was stuck. We ran
close by her, for there was water enough for our
little boat, although the rapid deposit from the
river had built up a bank to the surface of the
water on one side of the steamer. We were
sorry for these men, who were in a hurry to get
to St. Michael's, and so on home; at the same
time we could not resist the temptation to return
to them their greetings of the morning, and
offer to take letters to their friends. They did
not seem to be so much amused at the joke as
they had been in the morning&mdash;probably because
they had heard it before.</p>

<p>We were several days floating through this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
monotonous part of the river. There were always
the same banks of silt, from which portions,
undercut by the current, were continually crashing
into the stream; these were immediately
taken up and hurried along by the current to
form part of the vast deposit of mud which the
Yukon has built up at its mouth, and which has
filled up the Behring sea until it is shallow and
dangerous. On the higher banks, which were
forty feet or so above the river (it was then low
water), spruce and other trees were growing, and
as the soil which bore them was undercut, they
too dropped into the river and started on their
long journey to the sea. Along the vast tundra
at the Yukon mouth, and the treeless shores of
the Behring sea, the natives depend entirely upon
these wandered trees for their fuel. The quantity
brought down every year is enormous, for the
stream is continually working its way sidewise,
and cutting out fresh ground.</p>

<p>Everywhere we noticed the effects of the ice
which comes grinding down the river in the
spring. The trees had been girdled by the ice
and were dying, the underbrush cut down, the
earth plowed up, and occasionally there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
piles of pebbles where a grounded cake had
melted and deposited its burden.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Break-up of the Ice on the Yukon.</span></div>
</div>

<p>We used to camp on the gravel bars mostly, to
avoid the mosquitoes; but every now and then a
night was cool and even frosty, and the mosquitoes
and gnats, after starting in their assault,
were gradually numbed, and their buzzing grew
fainter and fainter till it disappeared. When we
felt such nights coming on, we camped in the
spruce groves on the higher banks, built roaring
fires and sat by them comfortably and smoked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
looking out on the smooth river with the dark
even fringe of trees between it and the sky with
its snapping stars; and for the first time on our
trip we began to have some of the pleasures
which usually come to the camper-out.</p>

<p>We passed Indian hunting and fishing camps
occasionally, and once a solitary white man engaged
in cutting wood for the river steamers.
The natives seemed always to have plenty to eat,
and we frequently obtained from them fish,
duck, moose, and berries. As we passed a camp
the inhabitants would put out in their tiny birch-bark
canoes, if we did not stop; and, overtaking
us with ease, would hold up for purchase such
articles as they had. The berries were in native
dishes of hewn wood, or of birch-bark tied with
wooden thongs, and were so quaint that we took
them home as curiosities.</p>

<p>After several days in the Flats, we saw&mdash;when
the clouds lifted after a prolonged rainstorm&mdash;that
the course of the river was apparently
barred by low mountains, level-topped,
with occasional higher peaks rising above the
general level, but all with smooth and rounded
outlines. As we drew nearer we saw a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
valley cutting through the mountains, and into
this the river ran. Just before entering, we
found a trading post, Fort Hamlin by name, and
from the trader, who was the only white man
here, we each bought a pair of Eskimo water-boots,
made of the skin of the makalok or hair
seal, soaked in oil. We had long ago worn out
the most of our civilized foot-gear, and were
obliged to adopt the native styles. These Eskimo
boots often have soles of walrus, and yet they
are too thin for walking over stones, so they are
made very large, and dried grass is put into the
bottom; the foot, too, is wrapped in as many
thicknesses of cloth or skins as possible, and thus
is protected against bruises and against the cold
of the severest winter weather.</p>

<p>Leaving Fort Hamlin, we floated down through
picturesque hills, on the sides of which the birch
was beginning to yellow. Another day brought
us to Mynook Creek, of which we had heard at
Circle City as likely to be a good gold producer.
At the mouth of the creek we found the temporary
camps of a few prospectors, who were on
their way up to stake out claims. There were
also numerous Indians encamped in the vicinity&mdash;true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
savages, with very few words of English
among them, "yes" "no" and "steamboat"
making up almost their entire vocabulary.</p>

<p>A sort of chief among them was a Mynook, a
half-breed with more Indian than white in his features.
It was after him that the creek had been
named (or rather renamed, for it had formerly
been known as the Klanakakat or Klanachargut,
the native name); he had been the first to discover
gold, and was engaged in working a claim with
a crew of natives, notwithstanding the fact that
Indians have, according to our somewhat peculiar
laws, no legal right to stake mines. He was a
good-looking fellow with a fair knowledge of
English, which he was very proud to air,
especially the "cuss-words," which he introduced
into conversation very gravely and irrelevantly.
He said when he got dust enough he was going
to "San Francisco," that being to him a general
name for the world of the white men. He had
always hired natives to work his claims, although
he admitted that they did not work nearly as
well as white people; they would labor only
until they had a little money ahead, and then
would quit until it was all spent, although it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
might be the very busiest season; and if perchance
a steamboat was reported on the river,
the gang to a man would drop pick and shovel
and trot down the trail to the mouth of the
creek, there to stand open-eyed and open-mouthed,
gazing at the smoking monster which
held them with a fascination stronger than even
Mynook's displeasure.</p>

<p>We camped on the beach, and made preparations
the next morning to visit the diggings. We
separated, as usual, each taking a different route,
and each hiring an Indian to accompany him and
carry his pack. The first Indian I hired had on
a new gingham jumper, and a sly smile which
gave an impression that his subsequent actions
did not belie. He wanted to be paid before
starting, and when this was refused said he was
hungry, and was so weak that he could not walk
without food. So we administered to him a substantial
breakfast, after which he disappeared
and never could be found again. Soon another
Indian presented himself&mdash;a particularly wicked
looking fellow, with red bulging eyes that gave
one a sort of shiver to look at him. He wanted
to go with me, and I hired him, having no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
choice. Then he too explained by gestures, that
he was starving and must have some breakfast to
keep him strong on his long walk; whereupon I
explained, also by gestures, that the first Indian
had gotten the second Indian's breakfast already,
and that, having delivered the breakfast, the rest
was no affair of mine (I having carried out my
share of the transaction as was fitting), so that
the only possible subject for discussion lay between
him and the first Indian.</p>

<p>He seemed to be impressed with the logic of
this, shouldered his pack and trotted off meekly
enough. As we started, the smoke of a steamboat
became visible down the river; the natives
raised the excited cry of "shteemboot" and my
guide showed signs of sitting down to wait for
it to come and go before he should proceed with
his journey. However, a few studiously stern
looks, accompanied by prodding in his ribs with
a stick, started him along the trail, to which he
kept faithfully after that. This led through a
thick growth of alder brush, across brooks, but
always kept in the valley of the main stream,
on each side of which were hills with the bare
rocks peering from among the yellowing foliage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>After three hours' tramp, we turned up a little
side valley, and soon came upon a claim that was
being worked by a number of miners. This was
the only active one on this creek, and with the
exception of Mynook's claim on another small
branch, the only one being exploited on Mynook
Creek as a whole. Several other men, however,
had staked claims and were engaged in building
log cabins, preparatory to the winter's prospecting.</p>

<p>Here I dismissed my Indian, telling him by
signs to come back again on the next day.
During the two days he and I were out together,
we did not utter an articulate sound in
trying to communicate with one another. It
was of no use, for he could not understand the
English any better than I Yukon. So in this
case I looked at him fixedly and silently, and
pointed to the miner's cabin, laid my head on
my hand and shut my eyes, signifying that I
intended to sleep there. Then with my finger I
followed in the sky the course the sun would take
on the following day, halting at a point midway
in the afternoon; then, pointing to him, I imitated
the motion of a man carrying a pack, and with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
rapid movement of the finger indicated the trail
back to the mouth of the creek; finally with a
comprehensive gesture I gave him to understand
that he might do as he pleased in the meantime.
He disappeared immediately, coming back at
night to beg for food from my hosts; failing in
that, he bivouacked at a camp-fire, with a few
other Indians who were working on the creek, in
front of the miner's log cabin, and before we
were up in the morning had disappeared again.
At exactly the appointed time the next day,
however, he returned, ready for the harness, as
red-eyed, dumb and vicious-looking as ever.</p>

<p>The sign language of all these Yukon Indians
is wonderfully clever; it is also very complicated,
and I have seen two natives conversing fluently
behind a trader's back, using their faces and
hands in rapid movements which, however, conveyed
no idea to the uninitiated observer as to
their meaning. Some of their signs which I
have understood are remarkable for the clever
selection of a distinguishing characteristic to designate
a given object. For example, a white
man was expressed by stroking the chin as if it
were bearded. In this wild country razors were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
unknown and even scissors a rarity, so that all
white men wore thick and usually bushy beards,
while the natives had very little or no hair on
their faces. Since I wore spectacles, I was described
in sign language first by a gesture of
stroking the beard, which indicated that I was a
white man, and then by bending the thumb and
forefinger in a circle, and peering through this
circle, thereby sufficiently identifying me among
others.</p>

<p>At the cabin where I spent the night was a
man who had been on the exploring expedition
of Lieutenant Allen some years before,
when that young officer accomplished such
a splendid journey under such great difficulties,
through a barren and unknown country, ascending
the Copper River, descending the Tanana,
exploring the Koyukuk, and finally returning
to St. Michael's by way of the Yukon. On
learning that I was in the government service,
this man insisted on my becoming his guest.
He slept and ate in a little log cabin of his own,
where he had a bed built of hewn wood, which
was pretty exactly proportioned to his own
length and breadth. By a little careful manipulation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
however, we both managed to stretch out
on it and as the night was frosty and our covering
none of the thickest, neither of us objected
to the proximity of the other, although we were
so crowded that when one turned over the other
had to do so at the same time. In the morning
my "pardner," as he might fitly be called, had a
savory breakfast well under way when I opened
my eyes.</p>

<p>After our meal my host went to his work,
while I undertook a journey a little further up
the main stream to a tributary gulch. Here one
man was engaged in prospecting&mdash;Oliver Miller,
one of the remarkable prospectors of early Alaskan
times. He had been in this region many
years already, always prospecting, often lucky in
finding, but never resting or stopping to reap
the benefits of his discoveries, and always pushing
restlessly onwards towards new and unexplored
fields. In the early eighties he had been
among the first who had come to the Forty Mile
district from Stewart River and the other affluents
of the Yukon above the international boundary.
He discovered the creek still known by
his name&mdash;Miller Creek,&mdash;which really lies at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the headwaters of Sixty Mile Creek, but is separated
only by a low dividing ridge from the
gold-producing gulches at the head of Forty Mile
Creek, and is therefore usually reckoned as a
part of the Forty Mile district.</p>

<p>Miller Creek was one of the richest creeks in
the district and was soon staked out by eager
prospectors; but Miller himself got restless, and
saying the place was getting too crowded for
him, sold his claim one day for what he could
get, and investing the amount in "grub" and outfit,
started out over the hills alone, prospecting.
In the Birch Creek district, which was discovered
later, he found gold again, but as soon as miners
came in he sold out and went further. Now
after many wanderings he was in Mynook Creek,
and it was characteristic of the man that instead
of being industriously engaged in washing gold
in one of the already prospected tributaries
nearer the Yukon, he had vanished into the
brush, out of reach of the sound of pick and
shovel, and was nosing around among the rocks
and panning gravel.</p>

<p>According to directions, I left the trail, which
indeed ran no further, and followed the bank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the main stream, working my way through the
brush, till I came to a little brook, then went up
along this nearly to where it emerged from a
rocky gorge in the hills. At this point I came
upon a grassy nook under the birches, where a
fire was smouldering; and under a tree a man's
heavy blankets were spread on a bed of green
boughs, as if he had just stepped out. A couple
of kettles were standing near the fire, and a coat
was lying on the ground, while an axe was sticking
in the tree above the blankets. There was
no tent or any superfluities whatever, and it was
evident that this camping outfit was one of those
which a man may take on his back and wander
over hill and dale with. Not hearing or seeing
any sign of life, I sat down and waited, but no
one appearing after half an hour, I began following
a man's trail from the camp up the gorge,
tracing him by the bent grass and broken twigs.
After having gone a short distance, I heard the
thumping of a pick on a rocky wall in front and
above me, and gave a hail. The prospector came
down very slowly, his manner not being so much
that of a man who was sorry to see one&mdash;on the
contrary, he was pleasant and cordial&mdash;as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of one who is reluctantly dragged away from a
favorite employment. We went back to his
camp under the birches and as it was now noon
he invited me to dinner with him.</p>

<p>It was a sunny day, and the grass was warm
and bright, with the shadow of the delicate leaves
falling upon it; the mosquitoes had disappeared
in this period of frosty nights and chilly days, so
that the sylvan camp was ideal. Some boiled
beans, boiled dried apples, and bread, baked before
an open fire, constituted the meal; yet I remember
to this day the flavor of each article, so
delicious they appeared to my sharp appetite.
Miller was embarrassed somewhat about dishes.
He had by good luck two kettle covers, which
served as plates for us, and he was, he explained,
in the habit of using his sheath-knife to manage
the rest, for he had neither table-knife, fork, nor
spoon. I produced my own sheath-knife and assured
him that I was born with it in my mouth,
so to speak, and we set to eating cheerfully.</p>

<p>For a professional recluse, I found Miller
very cordial and communicative. He travelled
alone, he told me, not because he would not
have been glad of company, but because it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
hard to find any one to go with him, and almost
impossible that two "pardners," even when at
first agreeable, should remain very long without
quarrelling; so he had decided, as the simplest
solution, to carry out his ideas alone. He was
in the habit of exploring the most remote parts
of the territory, searching for minerals. He had
tramped over the mountains between the Yukon
and the Tanana, back and forth; and had been
a thousand miles up the Koyukuk, to where it
headed in a high range, climbing which, he had
looked out upon the Arctic ocean. On returning
down the river, he had been knocked out of
his boat by a "sweeper" (a log which extends
out from a bank over a stream, two or three
feet above the water). The current was so
rapid where he met with the accident that when
he rose to the surface his boat was some distance
ahead of him. He struck out swimming
to catch up with it, but, as if animated with a
perverse living spirit, the boat moved off on a
swifter current toward the centre of the river.
Soon he was in danger of being benumbed in
the icy water, and he was exhausted from his
efforts, yet he knew if he should swim to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
banks and lose his boat he would eventually perish
in the wilderness, without resource and hundreds
of miles from the nearest human being.
So he swam desperately, and when on the point
of giving up and sinking, a check in the current
ahead slackened the speed of the boat so that by
an effort he was able to reach it and grasp the
gunwale. But it was some time before he
gathered strength enough to pull himself aboard.</p>

<p>The history of the prospectors in any new
country, especially in Alaska, would be a record
of intensely interesting pioneering. Unfortunately
these men leave no record, and their hardships,
lonely exploring tours and daring deeds,
performed with a heroism so simple that it seems
almost comical, have no chronicler. They penetrate
the deserts, they climb the mountains, they
ascend the streams, they dare with the crudest
preparation the severest danger of nature. Some
of them die, others return to civilization and become
sailors or car-conductors or janitors; but
they are of the stuff that keeps the nation alive.
By that I do not mean the false or imitation
prospector, who has no courage or patience, but
only the greed of gold. Thousands of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
poured into Alaska after the Klondike boom, and
many of them turned back at the first sight of
Chilkoot Pass, which is nothing to frighten a
strong boy of twelve. Many more got enough
of Alaska in floating down the Yukon, and kept
on straight to St. Michael's, scarcely stopping in
any of the mining regions; thereby benefiting
the transportation companies greatly, and adding
much to the territory's sudden apparent
prosperity. But before the Klondike rush nearly
all the Alaskans were of the hardy true pioneer
type I write about.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I returned, and finding my Indian
punctually on hand at the appointed time,
we went back to the Yukon together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
THE LOWER YUKON.</h2>


<p>The next day we broke camp, and floating
down the river, soon entered the main
range of the Rampart Mountains. They were
not high, but picturesque, and the lower parts
and the valleys were gay with green and gold.
It was a perfect day, cool and clear. We stopped
for the night below the so-called rapids, which at
this time of low water were hardly noticeable.
An Indian came to our camp from his village
across the river, and we traded a can of condensed
milk with him for a silver salmon. I got
into his little narrow birch canoe, and managed
to paddle it with the feather-like paddle, thanks
to my experience in rowing a racing-shell; but
it required infinite care in balancing. I could
not help admiring the ease with which the Indian
managed the delicate boat when he left us
for home again, and wondering how these people
catch salmon out of canoes like these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Indian Fish-Traps.</span></div>
</div>

<p>All this day and the next we passed many
Indian villages, made up of white tents, with
red dried salmon hung up on frames in front.
Although these natives are classed as Indians,
(belonging to the group of Athabascans) and
although they show certain traits of physiognomy
like them, yet in their general nature
they are entirely different. Unlike the stoical
Sioux or Arapahoe of the United States, these
people are childlike and open in their manners.
They chatter freely in their own language,
whether it is understood or not; they are anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to give and get information; and they seize
the slightest excuse for a joke to giggle convulsively.
They are fine boatmen, and good
hunters and fishermen. All along the river
could be seen their traps of stakes, set in some
eddy near a bend of the river, and in the early
frosty mornings the squaws would come down
to the traps in their canoes,&mdash;which are broader
than those of the men, and managed by a wider
paddle&mdash;propelling them swiftly and rhythmically
along, crooning a song. They are an intelligent,
good-humored people, already a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
spoiled in their manners and ideas by contact
with whites who were hardly fitted to teach the
untutored savage. Yet they are on the whole
far from disagreeable people to deal with, and
although their habits did not always seem up to
the civilized standard, yet in contrast to the
Eskimos whom we saw further down the river,
they were models of cleanliness. There is no
lack of variety in their faces, and in one camp I
saw a woman whose dark beauty would have
ornamented the finest drawing-room. Whether
or not she had some share of white blood I do
not know.</p>

<p>These Indians, as a rule, have no chief, but
live in the most complete independence, the only
authority over them being that of the <i>shaman</i> or
medicine man, who attains his ascendency by his
cleverness in duping others to believe he has
supernatural gifts, such as prophecy. It is the
custom for any one who aspires to high position
to make prediction as to the weather, when the
next steamboat will arrive, and so on. When
his predictions become true frequently, he gradually
obtains influence.</p>

<p>Great travellers are the Alaskan Indians too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and at a trading post along this part of the
Yukon one may see, besides the Yukon Indians,
others from the Koyukuk, the Tanana, and even
the Kuskokwim; but one rarely sees Eskimos,
who are not such great wanderers, and when
they make voyages visit only the regions peopled
by their own race. Those Indians who live
on the flats of the river frequently go to the
mountains a long distance off to hunt. Dr. Dall,
in his "Alaska and its Resources," gives the
following translation of a song which he heard
a Koyukuk woman singing to her infant.</p>

<p>Although we saw fish in front of all the tents
and apparent contentment in every face, yet we
were told that the catch had not been nearly so
great as usual that summer, and that there must
inevitably be much suffering during the winter.
"Yes," said Mynook, at Mynook Creek, philosophically,
"Goin' be hard winter; tink old
people all die." We asked him why just the old
people, and he explained that the old people had
not been able to gather so much provisions as the
young and vigorous ones, and would therefore
sooner starve. We told him that in our country
we cared for the old first, and he seemed to think
such a custom very unjust, observing that the
old who had lived should die if there was any
famine, and make room for the younger ones
who could live yet a long time if they could get
food. It is starvation, one may add, which keeps
the Indian population of the whole Alaskan
interior within very meagre limits.</p>

<p>On the 3d of September we came to the mouth
of the Tanana, a large tributary which enters the
Yukon on the left side; the country around its
mouth is low, and the river itself splits into
many channels, forming a delta. On the bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of the Yukon opposite the mouth of the Tanana
we found a trading post with two white men and
a host of Indians. When we landed at the store
we were met by the Indians, the white men
having not yet observed us. The first was
evidently a shaman or medicine man, a copper-colored
old fellow with cross eyes and a cunning
wrinkle around his mouth. He ceremoniously
pulled off his buckskin gloves before offering his
hand to shake; then pointing his finger to the
sky he began a long speech in his own language,
with many gestures. We all listened very gravely,
and when he got through and looked at me with
an air of self-satisfaction and triumph, I placed
both hands on my stomach, and rolled my eyes,
then thumbed my nose at him, and finally began
to quote to him the immortal soliloquy of Hamlet
"To be or not to be," with much emphasis and
many variations. Everybody listened with evident
delight, especially the shaman, and when
we were through they conducted us up to the
trading post. An old fellow was smoking a
curiously carved wooden pipe, which filled the
soul of one of our party with the desire to obtain
it, since it seemed such a remarkable bit of native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
work. He offered five dollars for it as a starter,
and the old fellow, astounded but willing to
accept the gifts of the gods without questioning,
handed over the pipe with an alacrity that made
Goodrich examine it a little more before parting
with his money. On the bottom of the bowl
was stamped in the wood "Smith &amp; Co., New
York," and on closer inspection it was evident
that the apparent carving was in reality pressed,
and that the pipe was worth in the neighborhood
of twenty-five cents in the States.</p>

<p>We were welcomed by the trader, and after a
lunch with him floated down the river about
eight miles to the mission below. There our
eyes were delighted by a neat little building
with a belfry and bell, and actually two dormer
windows. It was the work of the pioneer Mike
Hess, from whom the stream entering the Yukon
above Mynook creek had been named. The
missionary was absent in a parochial call five
hundred miles away, but his wife and child and a
nurse were there. The missionary published
the only paper on the Yukon at that time; it
appeared once a year, and consisted of four small
pages, printed on a hand-press. The items were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
from all over the country, and many of them
were very interesting and amusing.</p>

<p>From here we kept on travelling with the
current down the Yukon, helping our speed by
continuous rowing. There being three of us,
"tricks" of one hour were arranged, so each
man steered for an hour, rowed an hour, and
then sat in the stern for an hour, regarding the
landscape and making notes. It grew so chilly
that often the time for resting was hardest to
endure, for the skin would cool and the teeth
would chatter even with all the clothes we could
get on, and we would be glad to get a little
vigorous exercise again. Storms were frequent,
and we often had the pleasure of sitting in the
driving rain all day long. We covered over our
outfit as well as we could and even rigged up a
sort of awning of sail-cloth on a frame-work of
boughs, which kept the rain off the steersman,
while the man who was resting crawled under
a tarpaulin, and the oarsman rowed and got wet;
so that under these conditions the position of
steersman was most coveted. The wind blew
with such violence that sometimes we took water
over the bow and stern of our boat, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
steerman had to exert skill to keep from swamping.
When the weather was clear, however, it
was cool, and we enjoyed life more at such times
than we had before done.</p>

<p>To wake up on a gloriously bright morning, in
a tent pitched beneath spruce trees, and to look
out lazily and sleepily for a moment from the
open side of the tent, across the dead camp-fire
of the night before, to the river, where the light
of morning rests and perhaps some early-rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
native is gliding in his birch canoe; to go to the
river and freshen one's self with the cold water,
and yell exultingly to the gulls and hell-divers,
in the very joy of living; or to wake at night,
when you have rolled in your blankets in the
frost-stricken dying grass without a tent, and to
look up through the leaves above to the dark
sky and the flashing stars, and hear far off the
call of a night bird or the howl of a wolf: this
is the poetry, the joy of a wild and roving existence,
which cannot come too often. No one
need look for such moments during mosquito
time in Alaska. But the pests were over now,
and men and animals who had been fighting them
all summer rested and drew deep draughts of
peace, and strengthened themselves for the stinging
cold of the winter, likewise hard on the
temper and on the vital powers.</p>

<p>In our downward journey we passed close by
mountains whose tops were beginning to be
snow-covered, and were higher than those of the
Rampart Mountains, which we had crossed above
the Tanana; yet they were further from the
river, with level country between. Leaving
these behind we came to flats similar to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
great Yukon flats above the Ramparts, but not
so extensive. Here the river split into many
channels, enclosing low green islands. The clay
banks were fifty or a hundred feet high, and as
we followed the current it took us against the
side which it was engaged in cutting away. We
had to avoid getting too close, for one never
knew when a portion, undermined by the
stream, would topple over with a tremendous
splash; and if such a mass should strike the boat
it would bear it to the bottom of the river and
bury it so deeply and easily that when the dust
of the fall should clear away, the circles on the
water would be as regular as usual.</p>

<p>The banks showed on the upper parts, deposits
of black peat, twenty or thirty feet thick,
and it was evident that the accumulations are
going on at the surface yet. Alaska is, like
other Arctic regions, densely covered with moss,
which grows alike in the swamps and on the
steep hillsides; and the successive generations
of mosses, one rearing itself on the remains
of the others, bring about in time a deposit
of peat which one can find nearly everywhere,
if he digs down. It is well known that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
vegetable accumulations, after having been transformed
into peat, may by further change become
a lignite or sort of brown coal, and when much
altered by the heat or pressure attending the
uneasy movement of the earth's crust may even
become anthracite. In many regions the crust,
apparently still, is in reality constantly moving,
although so slowly that we do not notice it;
yet in the course of ages the most stupendous
changes have been brought about. We are accustomed
to picture coal as originating in tropical
swamps of the carboniferous period, with
enormous trees bearing leaves many feet long,
and bullfrogs as big as men squatting in the
background, while the air is so heavily laden
with carbonic acid that it would put out a candle;
but here, at the Arctic Circle, the formation
of coal is evidently going on rapidly, and future
generations may derive benefit from it.</p>

<p>Beds of vegetable matter belonging to a past
age are abundant all along the Yukon, but the
coal is as yet only a black shiny lignite, for it has
not been altered much; and leaves found in it
show that the vegetation of the period when the
beds accumulated was not far different from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
what it is to-day, and had nothing to do with
gigantic tadpoles and malaria.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the high clay
bluffs which we passed lies on the left-hand side
of the river, not far below the Tanana. It has
been called by some early travellers the Palisades,
and this name appears on the map, but the miners
and traders know it by the name of the Boneyard,
from the fact that there are buried in the
silts near the top (which is about two hundred
feet high) many bones of large animals, which
come down to the river as portions of the bluff
are undermined and fall. We stopped at this
place, and, slumping through the mud to the foot
of the bluff, we came across the tusk of a mammoth,
which probably weighed over a hundred
and fifty pounds. It was as thick as a man's leg
at its larger end, but the whole of it was evidently
not there. Further on we found a smaller
tusk with the end worn off as if the animal had
been using it severely for some purpose. Afterwards
we saw other bones,&mdash;leg bones, fragments
of the backbone, etc.,&mdash;in great abundance.
Our little boat was too small to carry these
gigantic relics, but we preserved a huge molar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
tooth from a mammoth, measuring several inches
across, and we sawed off portions of one of the
tusks.</p>

<p>The extinct hairy elephant, or mammoth, inhabited
Alaska at a time previous to the memory
of man, yet not very ancient, geologically speaking.
Remains of these animals are also abundant
in Arctic America and Siberia. It was at first
supposed that the climate was tropical when they
existed, since it is well known that the elephant
is a native of hot countries, and the bones are
almost exactly like those of the elephants of the
tropics. The discovery of some of these remains
in the River Lena in Siberia was one of the most
interesting of modern scientific events. From
some reason or the other, many mammoth had
been caught in the ice of the river and had been
frozen in, the ice never melting through all the
thousands of years that followed. So well preserved
were they at the time of their discovery
that it is said they furnished food for dogs; but
what amazed scientists most was to find that
this elephant was covered with very long hair or
fur, forming a protection against the cold such
as few creatures possess. The fur and much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the skin of one of these mammoth may be seen
in the museum at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>We know from geologic evidence that Alaska,
firm and solid land though it appears to be, is
really slowly rising out of the sea, and we also
know that this rising motion has been going on
for a very long time. At a period which must
have been many hundred years ago, the country
was covered with a multitude of shallow lakes,
many of them large, and some of immense size&mdash;rivalling
our Great Lakes of the St. Lawrence
river system. Most of these lakes are now
drained and we have, as records of them, only
broad flats composed of fine clays and silts which
accumulated as sediments in the lake bottoms.
Through this vast lake region roamed the mammoth
in herds, and so far as we can tell the
climate was much the same as it is now; but
with the elevation of the land and the draining
of the lakes the mammoth has disappeared&mdash;the
reason no one is able to tell.</p>

<p>The Eskimos carve the mammoth tusks into
ornaments, pipes, and other ivory articles. They
are familiar, in fancy, with the animal, and
have a special name for it, as well as for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
ivory as distinguished from walrus ivory. They
also have some vague legends about it, which
the traveller may learn through an interpreter.
At St. Michael's a Mahlemut Eskimo told me
that a long time ago, when the whole country
was full of lakes and darker than it is
now, these animals were alive, and in the time
of their fathers they were said to still exist, far
in the interior, on the shores of a great lake;
and that their fathers never went near this
lake, hunting, for fear of this beast. It is more
than likely, however, knowing what we do of
the Eskimo habits and character, that this was
simply fancy, which grew out of finding the
tusks and the bones; or an invention, gotten up
to satisfy the white man's curiosity, for the
Eskimo is so willing to please that he always
tells exactly what he thinks will be appreciated,
whether or not it is the truth. Moreover, so far
as I have been able to judge from other things,
the Eskimo tradition does not run nearly so far
back as it needs must to extend to the time of the
mammoth.</p>

<p>Breaking camp one morning, just as the smoke
was beginning to curl from the camp of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Siwash neighbors on the other bank of the river,
we ran rapidly down stream, and by the early
afternoon passed the mouth of the Koyukuk.
This is a large stream of clear water contrasting
sharply with the muddy roily waters of the
Yukon, from which it is separated almost by a
distinct line. Above the rivers at the point of
junction rises a beautiful sharp cliff, probably a
thousand feet high and nearly perpendicular to
the top.</p>

<p>On reaching this place we were met by heavy
winds which tossed the surface of the river into
waves, and where it blew against the current
made a chop sea, so that the Skookum took in a
good deal of water. Soon we were unable to
make any headway at all against the wind, so
we landed, and tracking our boat along the bank
till we came to a little "slough" or shallow
side channel where the water, protected by trees
which grew on both sides, was smooth, we made
camp. It was a flat smooth place, and the ground
was covered thickly with fuzzy bright green
plants of the horse-tail family, which made everything
look so downy that one felt like rolling in
it. These beautiful plants are easily crushed under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
foot, and a little tramping around had the
effect of pressing out the water with which the
sand was filled, and transforming all into a very
soft mud. We had to keep our heavy boots on,
therefore, especially around the fire, which is the
most frequented spot in a pioneer's camp; and
finally we had to lay poles along the path between
the camp and the boat, to prevent slumping
too deeply. To add to our discomforts, the
rain came down in torrents that night, piercing
our somewhat service-worn tent, so that by morning
most of our outfit, including blankets, was
more or less wet.</p>

<p>Starting out again, we found, soon after leaving
our sheltered nook, that the wind was still
blowing, and in stretches of the river where the
wind was ahead we could move only very slowly,
while on other curves we went at a high rate of
speed. So we moved along by jerks till about
noon, when we were brought to a standstill by
an increase in the wind, and after an effort to
proceed further, which resulted in our being
blown back a little up the river, we landed,
waited an hour and lunched; after this, the wind
having gone down somewhat, we proceeded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
We passed several native villages, both winter
and summer camps, the former with their
clumsily built log houses and attendant log
caches, the latter with their white tents and
lines of fish drying on frames in front. The inhabitants
shouted out vociferous greetings to us
as we passed, which we did not understand; but
we responded quite as cordially in our own
tongue. At about five o'clock we reached the
native village of Nulato, one of the largest on
the river, with a population of several hundred,
and a small trading post, at that time kept by a
half-breed trader.</p>

<p>Our first question on landing was whether the
steamer had passed down the Yukon for St.
Michael's. This steamer would be the last which
would make connections with Seattle or San
Francisco, so if we missed it we would be obliged
to remain all winter in the country. We knew
approximately when the boat would leave Circle
City, and from time to time, as we had been
floating down the river, we had inquired at trading
posts whether she had yet passed us, for this
would be very easy by day in the many channels
of the Flats, and still easier by night, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
as the river, even when confined in a single
channel, is often several miles wide in this lower
part, and a steamer passing on one side would
hardly be observed from our camp on the other
bank.</p>

<p>We had last heard at the station opposite the
mouth of the Tanana that she had not yet
passed, though she was daily expected&mdash;but that
was several days ago. Of course we would have
been able to lie by at any of these posts and
camp until the steamer should arrive; but so
great was our desire to make the best possible
use of every minute we had to stay in Alaska
that we preferred to take the risk of being left
all winter, with an opportunity of building a log
hut and laying in fire-wood till spring, rather
than lose the last part of our journey in the
Skookum. But we were relieved by the trader
at Nulato, who told us that the steamer had not
arrived. We were then given the use of a log
cabin, with glass windows, which was sumptuously
furnished with a stove, a hewn-wood bed,
a table and a three-legged stool.</p>

<p>After supper we made the tour of the village,
crawling into the little cabins of the natives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
where the women sat cross-legged in groups, occupied
in their sewing. They were making
gloves of moose-skin trimmed with beaver, caps
of the ground squirrel or marmot fur, and high
boots of the hair seal with bottoms of walrus
hide. Most of them used steel needles, though
many still kept to those of pierced bone, which
seemed in skillful hands to serve the purpose
quite as well. Our curiosity was soon satisfied,
for each dwelling was much like every other; so
after we had made bargains for some of the articles,
we went back to our cabin and turned in.
The joy of having a roof over our heads as a protection
against the rain which was now pelting
down was so great that I lay awake some little
time staring gloatingly up at the logs.</p>

<p>In the morning the one whose turn it was to
cook rose early, and soon large kettles were full
of beans, dried apples and rice, and all were
boiling merrily away, while the bacon sizzled
and smoked in the frying-pan. The other two
of us lay lazily in our blankets, and sniffed the
delicious odors, turning now and then from side
to side when the hewn logs upon which we were
lying grew conspicuously hard.  Suddenly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
door was burst open and a deaf-and-dumb Indian
who had made himself useful the night before,
bringing us wood and water in consideration of
a square meal afterwards, rushed in, and with
many gestures began to try to make us understand
something. We had seen a surprisingly
large number of deaf mutes among the natives,
and they were always more easy to understand
than the others, who had the habit of sputtering
and choking away in their own tongue, although
they knew very well that we did not understand
a word of it; while the deaf mutes immediately
enlightened us by some of the signs they were
so practiced in making. This one, by energetic
revolutions of his hands around one another,
recalled to us immediately the stern-wheel of a
steamboat, while the puffing he made with his
mouth took away all doubt as to his meaning.
Then he pointed up the river, and gesticulated
violently.</p>

<p>We all turned out on the double quick, and,
sure enough, the steamer was not more than a
half a mile away. She was due to stop at Nulato
a half hour to get wood, and so heavy was the
traffic on the river at this time of the year and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
so important every hour in making connections
with the ocean steamer that we knew she
could not be got to stay longer. So we began
hasty and energetic preparations, first rolling
our blankets and strapping them with our
personal outfit into the pack-sacks which we had
carried throughout the trip, then hurriedly
bundling together tents, specimens, and whatever
else we deemed necessary and practicable to take
out of Alaska with us. Many of the more
cumbersome articles we abandoned, as they were
much worn, and it would cost more than the
original price to carry them back to the United
States at the extraordinary prices for freight
then prevailing. The natives soon became aware
of our hurry and hung around in numbers, eager
to help, but generally getting in the way; each
had his eye on some article which he hoped to
fall heir to. To many of these natives, poor
beyond our ordinary conception of poverty, a
nicked camp-axe is a substantial private fortune,
and one Siwash to whom this article was awarded
for general good conduct marched off in great
happiness. Another fell heir to our boat&mdash;the
faithful old Skookum, who had carried us two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
thousand miles, and now was somewhat battered
and leaky as the result of her travels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the steamer had swung in close to
the flat high bank, the gang planks had been
dropped down, and scores of natives, partly
those of the village and partly those who had
come on the steamer, scampered back and forth
carrying wood on board in the most clumsy and
ridiculous fashion, but still accomplishing much
work by reason of their numbers. Miners, with
whom the boat was crowded, came ashore and
strolled around the village; they walked into our
cabin and pestered us with idle and aimless
questions, as we were working hard to get our
stuff ready to take on board. At the last moment,
when sufficient wood had been gotten in,
the whistle was blown; we grabbed our pack-sacks
and gave the remaining burdens to the natives to
carry, and hurried on board. We had left some
things, others than those mentioned. I felt then
a keen regret, which occurs to me whenever I
think of it, at being obliged to abandon all the
good "grub" which had been boiling and frying
away so merrily on the stove when our deaf-and-dumb
friend had roused us from our dream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
None of us being enthusiastic cooks, it had been
our custom to prepare large amounts of the stock
articles of diet at a time, in order that one cooking,
with some few additions, might last most of
each man's allotted time of three days; so the
quantity we left behind was ample to feed quite
a number of Siwash, and I have no doubt they
gorged themselves, and had lively times trying
to see who could eat the most and the quickest.</p>

<p>The steamer was packed. Miners who had
intended to go to the "Outside" this year, had
waited as late as they dared, so as to work their
claim and bring out as much as possible, and
then had taken this last boat. We found every
sleeping accommodation taken, and not until late
in the afternoon did the steward's resources find
us a place. The only available space left under
cover was that occupied by the tables in the
steerage division. After supper was eaten,
these tables were taken out, and the floor-room
thus gained was allotted us. The rest of the
floor was already occupied, and we had to exercise
great care to keep from rolling over into
another man's preserves. We spread our rubber
blankets on the deck to protect us from tobacco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
juice and other unpleasant things, and spread
our woollen blankets on these. Lights were put
out at about ten o'clock, and after that there was
considerable stumbling around.</p>

<p>On the forward deck in front of the steerage
department an active poker game, conducted by
a professional gambler, was continually in progress,
under a sail which had been rigged up as a
cover. This game always wore on until midnight
and attracted many interested spectators as
well as players, all crowding around the table on
which stacks of gold pieces were piled, under the
light of a lantern tied overhead. When the men
finally started to bed, they lost their bearings in
the almost complete darkness and wandered
far and wide, stumbling over the prostrate sleepers,
whose loud and heartfelt oaths disturbed the
peace almost as much as the hobnailed boots on
one's stomach. At the first glimmer of dawn&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
about three in the morning&mdash;we were routed
out and made to roll up our blankets out of the
way in order that the tables might be set up for
a seven o'clock breakfast; so on the whole our
sleep was light and short. Yet we had paid first-class
fares on boarding the boat. I have since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
taken a comfortable two-weeks' voyage on a
transatlantic steamer to Germany for the same
price as I paid for this passage to St. Michael's,
occupying four or five days.</p>

<p>The next day we stopped at the native village
of Anvik. By this time we had left the land of
the Indians or Ingeliks, which reaches down
the river below Nulato, and had reached that
of the Innuits or Eskimos. Anvik was the first
Eskimo village I had seen and the impression
I carried away with me was one of extreme
disgust. The whole place was a human sty,
from which arose an overpowering stink. The
houses were mere shacks built of poles laid close
together, with holes in the centre to allow the
smoke to escape. All around the houses, in
front, behind, and along the paths, was ordure.
Most of the people whom we saw had the appearance
of being diseased: whole rows of the
maimed, the halt, the blind, and the scrofulous,
sunned themselves in front of the huts.
Others sat huddled in their long fur shirts or
parkas (which constitute their only garment),
and coughed constantly, too sick to show much
interest in the white visitors. A little apart, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
front of the houses, a woman squatted, sobbing,
while beside her crouched an old crone with a
mouth like a fish, who crooned incessantly a
weird, monotonous and mournful chant, to which
the sobbing woman made brief responses at intervals.
Other women sat around in their doors,
all looking sad, and many sobbing. A young
Indian boy from the steamer, who had picked
up some English in a mission school, explained
the scene to us. "That woman's baby die," he
said. "Everybody all day cry."</p>

<p>We were glad to turn away from the most
dismal and degraded set of human beings it had
ever been my lot to see; on our way back to the
steamer we passed a building of sawed boards
used as a mission, and met the missionary, who
was properly attired in a suit of clerical black,
with white linen and tie. He had a book in his
hand. I had rather seen him dressed in a parka,
with an axe over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Below Anvik a short distance, we came to the
Holy Cross Mission, a Catholic station located at
another Eskimo village. The village was only a
little better than that of Anvik to look at, but
somewhat better to smell of. The mission itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
however, was a model. The buildings were well-built
and clean, and there was a flourishing garden,
containing potatoes, rutabagas, cabbages
and lettuce, the whole surrounded by a rail
fence; and in another little enclosure there was
a real live cow, almost as much a novelty to us as
to the natives from further up the river, who left
the steamboat and pressed around the strange
animal with wondering eyes, as children view
the elephant at their first circus. We saw many
little girls, pupils of the school, spotlessly arrayed
in new calico dresses, with gay silk or
cotton handkerchiefs on their heads. They made
quite a pretty picture, and the contrast of the
little maidens with their relatives at Anvik was
something almost startling. These children had
been taken away from their parents by the sisters
who teach at the Mission and were being
brought up by them, to be sent away again only
when grown.</p>

<p>Between the Holy Cross Mission and the Yukon
delta the river grows continually wider till it is
in places fully five miles from bank to bank,
without islands. The banks themselves become
low and very flat, and the timber disappears almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
entirely, leaving the swampy plains known
as tundra. Along here the only fuel is driftwood;
and this the natives had stacked up in
places ready for the steamer. Landing to take on
wood was always the opportunity for a run on
shore, dickering with the natives for curiosities,
and general hilarity. The people here were wonderfully
different from those on the Yukon from
Nulato to the headwaters, being round and rosy,
rather small in stature, and with a certain Mongolian
appearance. They are childlike in look
and action, with round wondering eyes, and
mouths always ready to smile broadly and unreservedly
at any hint of a joke. They were
dressed in the Eskimo parka, made of furs of
various sorts, especially squirrel, mink, reindeer,
or muskrat. The whole sustenance of the people
in this barren tundra district appeared to be fish,
and many of them had been obliged to make their
parkas and leggings out of the fish skins, which
were sewn together with much neatness and
taste, and were ornamented with red ochre. In
wet weather they wore long shirts made of the
entrails of animals, split open and sewn together;
these had tight-fitting hoods and sleeves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
were practically watertight. The Eskimo kayak
or covered boat, made by stretching seal or
walrus skins over a wooden frame, makes its
appearance along here, although the birch canoe
is still to be seen. In the houses of these people
we saw sealskins full of oil laid up as a provision
against the winter.</p>

</div>

<p>At a mission further up the river a Russian
priest of the Greek Catholic church had gotten
on board. He wore the plain black gown, full
beard and long hair of men of his class, and
spoke broken English. He seemed well acquainted
with the country, however, and assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
us that these people were distinct both from the
Kolchane or Indians, who were found all along
the Yukon above Nulato, and from the Mahlemut
Eskimos. These middle people he called Kwikpaks;
but I am sure they are really Eskimos,
with perhaps some peculiarities, due to their
position on the border-line of two races differing
so greatly as do the Eskimos and the Indians.</p>

<p>The same day we left the Yukon for good,
emerging from the northern or Ap-hoon mouth,
(for the Yukon forms a delta which spreads out
many miles and includes many channels) out on
the open sea. We were struck with the color of
the clear green water, after so long viewing the
muddy brown Yukon or the clear black of some
of its tributaries. Before us the country was
barren, untimbered, and black, with volcanic
cones rising here and there. As we advanced,
low islands rose out of the sea around these
cones,&mdash;fields of lava, covered with swamps and
ponds,&mdash;while we left behind us the dead level
untimbered tundra of the Yukon delta. We
anchored under the lee of an island that night,
and as usual we were roused from our sleeping
places before daylight the next morning by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
cook. The sun rose gloriously from behind the
low black volcanic hills and just as we were getting
around to breakfast at the fourth table we
steamed into St. Michael's.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
ST. MICHAEL'S AND SAN FRANCISCO.</h2>


<p>St. Michael's is the usual port for the
Yukon, though seventy miles from its
mouth. The Russians had a fort and garrison at
this place before they sold the territory to the
United States, and since then the commercial
companies have had posts here. The chief part
of the population, however, consists of Eskimos.</p>

<p>These people are very expert in carving.
From stone they make axes, lamps, skin-scrapers
and many other implements; and from bone, and
especially from the walrus and mammoth ivory,
they carve many things, among them polished
pipes. These pipes are evidently modelled after
the opium pipes of the East, with a peculiar
shaped bowl having only a very small cavity in
it, and a long stem. They are ornamented with
many figures scratched on the ivory with a sharp
knife, and then colored by having charcoal and
grease rubbed into the scratches; these figures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of which there may be several hundred on a
single pipe, represent the Eskimo in his daily occupations,
especially his hunting of deer, wolf,
and whale, his dancing in the <i>kashim</i>, or his
travelling in his kayak.</p>

</div>

<p>Strolling around the village, and peering into
the <i>barabarras</i>, or private houses, I ran across an
old savage who was handling an object which
immediately attracted my attention; when he
saw my curiosity he explained by signs that it
was an apparatus for making fire, and at my request
he actually performed the feat. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the old plan of rubbing two sticks of wood together,
such as we have often read that savages
do; yet I had never known any one who knew
exactly how it was done, although as a boy I had
often worn myself out in vain endeavors to make
fire in this way. So far as I know, no one had
ever satisfactorily explained how the Alaskan
natives get their fire, one writer having even
supposed that they brought it from volcanoes in
the first place; and from the extraordinary care
which they take in preserving hot coals and
often in carrying them considerable distances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
one does not often see them in the process of obtaining
a new supply.</p>

<p>The apparatus which I saw here used was
simple and ingenious. In a thoroughly dry stick
of spruce were cut a number of little grooves,&mdash;this
was the wood destined to catch fire. The
other piece of wood was a rounded stick of some
very hard variety, which the Eskimo told me
was picked up in the driftwood along the shore:
it was very likely a foreign wood. The point of
the hard stick was set upright in one of the grooves
of the soft dry piece and by means of a leather
thong was made to revolve rapidly in it, the hard
upright piece being kept in place by a stone
socket set in a piece of wood, which was held in
the mouth of the operator. After vigorously
twirling the stick by means of the thong for
about a minute the soft wood began to smoke; a
moment afterwards a faint spark was visible.
Then the Eskimo stopped revolving the stick and
heaping all the fine dust of the soft wood which
had been worn off by the grinding on the spark,
and blew it carefully till it grew to larger dimensions;
then he placed a blade of dry grass on the
spark, and, blowing again, it burst into flame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
The whole process had lasted about three
minutes. The old man explained also that in
boring the holes in stone, bone or ivory, they
used the same device, employing a stone drill instead
of the wooden stick.</p>

<p>There was great commotion among the natives
at St. Michael's the morning after we arrived,
and the men all dragged their kayaks into the
water and getting into them paddled out into
the harbor, where a number of small whales
were seen disporting themselves. When they
neared the school the men separated, and when a
whale would sound they spread themselves out
so as to be nearly at the spot where he should
come up. Each man had several of the light
spears they used for capturing fish; these weapons
are perhaps three and a half feet long, and
weigh about a pound, the shaft being slender
and of light wood and the tip of a barbed piece
of bone. To each of these they had fastened by
a long thong, as they were paddling out, a
blown-up bladder. As soon as a whale rose the
Eskimo who happened to be near sent his little
spear with great force deeply into its flesh. The
wound was of course insignificant, and the animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
taking alarm, sank into the water again;
but when after some time he was forced to return
to the surface, he encountered several
hunters again, and received several more spears
with attached bladders. This time the buoyancy
of the bladders made it difficult for him to sink,
and he rose soon afterwards, only to be filled
with so many spears that the bladders kept him
from sinking at all; then the natives drew near
and with all kinds of weapons cut and slashed
and worried the creature till he finally gave up
from loss of blood, and died. Then he was
towed ashore amid great excitement and with
rejoicing, not only by the hunters, but by the
women, children and old men who flocked down
to the beach as it came in.</p>

<p>The next thing was to cut up and divide the
carcass, and this was done thoroughly, everybody
in the village coming in for a share. Nothing
was wasted. Even the blood was carefully
saved and divided, and the sinews were given to
the women, who would dry and make them into
threads for sewing. Soon all the fires in the village
were burning, and the smell of boiling
whale-flesh came from many pots, into which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the women peered expectantly. One old lady
whom I noticed doing this showed in her dress
some of the effects of civilization, which is a rare
thing with the Eskimo, as they dress by preference
in their squirrel or muskrat-skin parkas;
her flowing garment was made of flour-sacks
sewn together, and one might read the legend,
inscribed many times and standing in many attitudes,
that the wearer (presumably) was Anchor
Brand.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Captured Whale.</span></div>
</div>

<p>St. Michael's is made up of volcanic rock, and
has been lifted from the sea in recent geologic
times. The natives know this, and say that they
find lines of driftwood marking the ancient limit
of the waves, at places far above where the
highest water now reaches; on the other hand,
they say that the island has been thrice submerged
since the memory of man. Out of the
general swampy level of the land around the
village rise, further back, broken cones with old
craters at their tops; these were very likely under
the level of the sea when they were active. We
had time to spend a few days wandering over
this country, climbing through the rocky craters,
and looking down on the numberless swamp
lakes which cover the southeast side of the
island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> One day, however, we received sudden
word that the steamer on which we had engaged
passage was about to sail, and we hurried on
board. That night we were far out on Behring
Sea, tossing in a strong wind which soon increased
to a terrific gale.</p>

<p>We lay several days "hove to" in this gale,
with oil casks over the bows to break the great
waves which threatened more than once to
smash us and often seemed about to roll us over
and over. Finally, however, it quieted enough
to let the seasick ones drop asleep, while the
sailors made things taut again, and before long
we were in harbor at the island of Unalaska&mdash;one
of the great chain of Aleutian islands
which reaches from America to Asia, and the
chief stopping point for nearly all boats between
the Yukon mouth and the coast of the United
States proper. Unalaska is a country of chaotically
wild scenery. The streams in turn meander
over level benches and then tumble in waterfalls
over steep cliffs to the next bench, and so on till
they reach the sea; such a cataract we saw on
the right as we entered the harbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>In the village here we found the Aleuts semi-civilized
from their long contact with white men,
for here the Russians held direct control long
before the territory was sold to the United
States; they live in neat wooden houses, and if
one peeps in by night he may even see here and
there lace curtains and rocking-chairs.</p>

<p>Seventeen days after leaving St. Michael's we
finally reached San Francisco. It was a clear,
fine Sunday when we passed through the Golden
Gate, tingling with excitement which we had
felt since seeing the first land on the California
coast. The sight of the multitude of houses on
the hillside, the smoke of the city, the craft of
all kinds going back and forth, had in it something
very strange and discomposing for us. It
was only when the ship was at the dock, and we
had gone ashore, that we realized, from the way
the curious crowd formed a circle around us and
stared in open-mouthed wonder, that our appearance
was unusual for a city. We had not taken
much baggage through the Yukon country, and
our camp clothes were very shabby. None of us
had had opportunity to have hair and beard
trimmed since we left&mdash;with the result that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
had a mane reaching to the shoulders and fierce
bushy buccaneer whiskers, inches deep all around.
Two of us wore ancient high leather boots and
the third wore a kind of moccasin. We all had
heavy "mackinaw" trousers of blanket-cloth,
with belted coats of the same material, while
coarse flannel shirts and dilapidated felt hats,
burned with the sparks of many a camp-fire and
seamed with the creases of many a night's sleep,
completed our costume.</p>

<p>Finding the attention of the crowd embarrassing,
we took a carriage for the Grand Hotel, and
as we were driving through the streets I noticed
that if one so much as caught a glimpse of our
faces through the carriage window, he would
turn and stare after the cab till it was out of
sight. It was Sunday afternoon, and the streets
were filled with smartly dressed men and women.
For our part, the sight of all this correct and conventional
dressing made a disagreeable impression
on us, after so long a period of free and easy life;
the white collars and cuffs of the men, in particular,
obtruded themselves on my attention and
irritated me.</p>

<p>We had left our "store clothes" in Seattle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
had to telegraph to get them. It took a couple
of days for this, and in the meantime we had
only to wait. We had been looking forward to
going to the theatre as soon as we should arrive
in San Francisco, and when our clothes did not
arrive, were disappointed, till we suddenly
braced up in defiance of the whole city, and said,
"Let's go anyhow." We had not had time to
get our hair and beard trimmed, and our costume
was in all respects the same as when we left
Circle City, but we sallied out bravely. We
were late at the theatre, and the play had already
begun; it was a popular one, and the only seats
left were some in the "bald-headed" row.</p>

<p>Although we had by this time the idea forced
on us that our appearance was unusual, we were
by no means prepared for the commotion which
we brought about, as we walked up the broad
aisle to our seats. There was a hum and a
sizzle of whispers throughout the house, which
changed to laughter and exclamations; and the
actors on the stage, catching sight of us, got
"rattled" and forgot to go on. Up in the peanut
gallery the gods began to indulge in catcalls
and make personal inquiries. We hurried to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
seats to escape this storm, and meeting an usher
thrust our tickets into his hand. He looked at
us with a puzzled air and a broad grin, as if he
thought it all some huge joke, but we were getting
nervous, and gave him a glare which made
him indicate our seats for us. The audience
evidently believed we were part of the show;
many were standing by this time, waiting to see
what the next would be, but after a while the
buzz subsided and the play went on. There was
a constant current of conversation about us, however;
behind us a young fellow was excitedly
asking his companion "Who are they, who are
they?" "Don't know," said the other. "Sailors,
I guess."</p>

<p>After a while we felt like returning to the
solitude of our hotel rooms; the play, too, did
not please us, so in the middle of an act we got
up, and having remarked very audibly "Dis is
a rotten show," we went. As we started down
the aisle the commotion grew louder than ever,
and we slipped quickly out and down a side
street.</p>
